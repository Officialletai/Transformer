General marking guidance 
These notes offer general guidance, but the specific notes for examiners appertaining to individual questions take precedence.

All candidates must receive the same treatment. Examiners must mark the last candidate in exactly the same way as they mark the first. 
Where some judgement is required, mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded; exemplification/indicative 
content will not be exhaustive. When examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a candidate’s response, 
the response should be sent to review. 

All the marks on the mark scheme are designed to be awarded; mark schemes should be applied positively. Examiners should also be 
prepared  to  award  zero  marks  if  the  candidate’s  response  is  not  worthy  of  credit  according  to  the  mark  scheme.  If  there  is  a  wrong 
answer (or no answer) indicated on the answer line always check the working in the body of the script (and on any diagrams), and award 
any marks appropriate from the mark scheme.  

Questions where working is not required: In general, the correct answer should be given full marks. 
Questions that specifically require working: In general, candidates who do not show working on this type of  question will get no 
marks – full details will be given in the mark scheme for each individual question. 

Crossed out work 
This should be marked unless the candidate has replaced it with  
an alternative response.  

Choice of method 
If there is a choice of methods shown, mark the method that leads to the answer given on the answer line. 
If no answer appears on the answer line, mark both methods then award the lower number of marks.  

Incorrect method 
If it is clear from the working that the “correct” answer has been obtained from incorrect working, award 0 marks. Send the response to 
review for your Team Leader to check.  

Follow through marks 
Follow  through  marks  which  involve  a  single  stage  calculation  can  be  awarded  without  working  as  you  can  check  the  answer,  but  if 
ambiguous do not award. 
Follow through marks which involve more than one stage of calculation can only be awarded on sight of the relevant working, even if it 
appears obvious that there is only one way you could get the answer given.

Ignoring subsequent work 
It is appropriate to ignore subsequent work when the additional work does not change the answer in a way that is inappropriate for the 
question or its context. (eg an incorrectly cancelled fraction when the unsimplified fraction would gain full marks). 
It is not appropriate to ignore subsequent work when the additional work essentially makes the answer incorrect (eg. incorrect algebraic 
simplification). 

Probability 
Probability answers must be given as a fraction, percentage or decimal.  If a candidate gives a decimal equivalent to a probability, this 
should be written to at least 2 decimal places (unless tenths).   
Incorrect notation should lose the accuracy marks, but be awarded any implied method marks. 
If a probability fraction is given then cancelled incorrectly, ignore the incorrectly cancelled answer. 

Linear equations 
Unless indicated otherwise in the mark scheme, full marks can be gained if the solution alone is given on the answer line, or otherwise 
unambiguously identified in working (without contradiction elsewhere).  Where the correct solution only is shown substituted, but not 
identified as the solution, the accuracy mark is lost but any method marks can be awarded (embedded answers). 

Range of answers 
Unless otherwise stated, when an answer is given as a range (eg 3.5 – 4.2) then this is inclusive of the end points (eg 3.5, 4.2) and all 
numbers within the range 

Number in brackets after a calculation 
Where there is a number in brackets after a calculation eg 2 × 6 (=12) then the mark can be awarded either for the correct method, 
implied by the calculation or for the correct answer to the calculation. 

Use of inverted commas  
Some numbers in the mark scheme will appear inside inverted commas eg “12” × 50 ; the number in inverted commas cannot be any 
number – it must come from a correct method or process but the candidate may make an arithmetic error in their working.  

13      Word in square brackets 

Where a word is used in square brackets eg [area] × 1.5 : the value used for [area] does not have to come from a correct method or 
process but is the value that the candidate believes is the area. If there are any constraints on the value that can be used, details will 
be given in the mark scheme. 

14  Misread 

If a candidate misreads a number from the question. eg uses 252 instead of 255; method or process marks may be awarded provided 
the question has not been simplified. Examiners should send any instance of a suspected misread to review.

Only mark scheme amendments are shown where the enlargement or modification of the paper requires a change in the mark scheme.   
Notes apply to both MLP papers and Braille papers unless otherwise stated. 

The following tolerances should be accepted on marking MLP papers, unless otherwise stated below: 
Angles: ±5º

Question 
5 

Modification 

Mark scheme notes 
Standard mark scheme 

  Wording added ‘Look at the diagram for Question 5 in the Diagram Booklet. It shows a regular 

hexagon and a regular pentagon which share a common side.’.  
Diagram enlarged. The angle moved outside of the angle arc and the angle arc made smaller. 
For Braille the diagram has hexagon ABCDEF and pentagon GHICB with x outside the angle arc.  
Wording now “The diagram is a regular hexagon, ABCDEF, and a regular pentagon, GHICB, 
joined at the common side, BC.”   “In the diagram, angle DCI is marked x.”

(a)  Wording added ‘Complete the table below…’.  The table turned vertical.  

Standard mark scheme 

Wording added ‘There are four spaces to fill.’ 
For Braille Add (i), (ii), (iii) & (iv) in the blank spaces and “Ans: (i) __ (ii) __ (iii) __ (iv) __” 

(b)  Wording added ‘Look at the diagram for Question 6(b) in the Diagram Booklet. It shows a grid.’  

Standard mark scheme 

Diagram enlarged. Open headed arrows. Small squares removed.  
The axes labels moved to the top of the vertical axis and to the right of the horizontal axis. 

  Wording added ‘Look at the diagram for Question 7 in the Diagram Booklet. It shows cube A and 

Standard mark scheme 

cube B.’  
Wording added ‘Cube A has sides of length 3 cm’; ‘Cube B has sides of length 4 cm.’  
Diagram enlarged. The diagrams relabelled as ‘cube A’ and ‘cube B’. 
Braille: have a model with the words “The models represent two cubes, A and B.”

(a)  Wording added ‘Look at the table for Question 10 in the Diagram Booklet. It shows…’.  

B1 for 10, 25, 55, 70, 80, 100 

The values changed so that the answers can be read on a grid line.  
25 changed to 30.  30 changed to 15.  5 changed to 10.  15 changed to 20. 
Wording added ‘Complete the cumulative frequency table below.’ ‘There are six spaces to fill.’
