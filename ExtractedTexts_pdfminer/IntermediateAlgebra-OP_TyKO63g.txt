About Intermediate Algebra

Intermediate Algebra is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of a one-semester Intermediate algebra
course. The book’s organization makes it easy to adapt to a variety of course syllabi. The text expands on the fundamental
concepts of algebra while addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles. Each topic
builds upon previously developed material to demonstrate the cohesiveness and structure of mathematics.

Coverage and Scope

Intermediate Algebra continues the philosophies and pedagogical features of Prealgebra and Elementary Algebra, by Lynn
Marecek and MaryAnne Anthony-Smith. By introducing the concepts and vocabulary of algebra in a nurturing, non-
threatening environment while also addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles, the
book helps students gain confidence in their ability to succeed in the course and become successful college students.

The material is presented as a sequence of small, and clear steps to conceptual understanding. The order of topics was
carefully planned to emphasize the logical progression throughout the course and to facilitate a thorough understanding
of each concept. As new ideas are presented, they are explicitly related to previous topics.

Chapter 1: Foundations
Chapter 1 reviews arithmetic operations with whole numbers, integers, fractions, decimals and real numbers, to
give the student a solid base that will support their study of algebra.

Chapter 2: Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities
In Chapter 2, students learn to solve linear equations using the Properties of Equality and a general strategy.
They use a problem-solving strategy to solve number, percent, mixture and uniform motion applications. Solving
a formula for a specific variable, and also solving both linear and compound inequalities is presented.

Chapter 3: Graphs and Functions
Chapter 3 covers the rectangular coordinate system where students learn to plot graph linear equations in two
variables, graph with intercepts, understand slope of a line, use the slope-intercept form of an equation of a line,
find the equation of a line, and create graphs of linear inequalities. The chapter also introduces relations and

2

Preface

functions as well as graphing of functions.

Chapter 4: Systems of Linear Equations
Chapter 4 covers solving systems of equations by graphing, substitution, and elimination; solving applications
with systems of equations, solving mixture applications with systems of equations, and graphing systems of linear
inequalities. Systems of equations are also solved using matrices and determinants.

Chapter 5: Polynomials and Polynomial Functions
In Chapter 5, students learn how to add and subtract polynomials, use multiplication properties of exponents,
multiply polynomials, use special products, divide monomials and polynomials, and understand integer exponents
and scientific notation.

Chapter 6: Factoring
In Chapter 6, students learn the process of factoring expressions and see how factoring is used to solve quadratic
equations.

Chapter 7: Rational Expressions and Functions
In Chapter 7, students work with rational expressions, solve rational equations and use them to solve problems in
a variety of applications, and solve rational inequalities.

Chapter 8: Roots and Radical
In Chapter 8, students simplify radical expressions, rational exponents, perform operations on radical expressions,
and solve radical equations. Radical functions and the complex number system are introduced

Chapter 9: Quadratic Equations
In Chapter 9, students use various methods to solve quadratic equations and equations in quadratic form and
learn how to use them in applications. Students will graph quadratic functions using their properties and by
transformations.

Chapter 10: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
In Chapter 10, students find composite and inverse functions, evaluate, graph, and solve both exponential and
logarithmic functions.

Chapter 11: Conics
In Chapter 11, the properties and graphs of circles, parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas are presented. Students
also solve applications using the conics and solve systems of nonlinear equations.

Chapter 12: Sequences, Series and the Binomial Theorem
In Chapter 12, students are introduced to sequences, arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences and series and
the binomial theorem.

All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.

Key Features and Boxes

Examples Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving
approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple examples for each learning objective to model
different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.

All examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the
solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select examples), we show students how to check the solution.
Most examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way
that instructors “talk through” examples as they write on the board in class.

Be Prepared! Each section, beginning with Section 2.1, starts with a few “Be Prepared!” exercises so that students can
determine if they have mastered the prerequisite skills for the section. Reference is made to specific Examples from
previous sections so students who need further review can easily find explanations. Answers to these exercises can be
found in the supplemental resources that accompany this title.

Try It

Try it The Try It feature includes a pair of exercises that immediately follow an Example, providing the student
with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem with an easy reference to the example. In the PDF and the Web
View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key

How To

How To Examples use a three column format to demonstrate how to solve an example with a certain
procedure. The first column states the formal step, the second column is in words as the teacher would explain the
process, and then the third column is the actual math. A How To procedure box follows each of these How To examples
and summarizes the series of steps from the example. These procedure boxes provide an easy reference for students.

Media The “Media” icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Self Check. This icon marks a

list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.

Disclaimer: While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these
tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany Intermediate Algebra.

Self Check The Self Check includes the learning objectives for the section so that students can self-assess their mastery
and make concrete plans to improve.

Art Program

Intermediate Algebra contains many figures and illustrations. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style,
drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions.

Section Exercises and Chapter Review

Section Exercises Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as
homework or used selectively for guided practice. Exercise sets are named Practice Makes Perfect to encourage completion
of homework assignments.

Exercises correlate to the learning objectives. This facilitates assignment of personalized study plans based on
individual student needs.

Exercises are carefully sequenced to promote building of skills.

Values for constants and coefficients were chosen to practice and reinforce arithmetic facts.

Even and odd-numbered exercises are paired.

Exercises parallel and extend the text examples and use the same instructions as the examples to help students
easily recognize the connection.

Applications are drawn from many everyday experiences, as well as those traditionally found in college math texts.

Everyday Math highlights practical situations using the concepts from that particular section

Writing Exercises are included in every exercise set to encourage conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and
literacy.

Chapter review Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice
problems that students can use to prepare for exams.

Key Terms provide a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter.

Key Concepts summarize the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant
Example(s) in case students need to review.

Chapter Review Exercises include practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each section.

Practice Test includes additional problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter.

Answer Key includes the answers to all Try It exercises and every other exercise from the Section Exercises,
Chapter Review Exercises, and Practice Test.

Introduction

For years, doctors and engineers have worked to make artificial limbs, such as this hand for people who need them. This
particular product is different, however, because it was developed using a 3D printer. As a result, it can be printed much
like you print words on a sheet of paper. This makes producing the limb less expensive and faster than conventional
methods.

Biomedical engineers are working to develop organs that may one day save lives. Scientists at NASA are designing ways to
use 3D printers to build on the moon or Mars. Already, animals are benefitting from 3D-printed parts, including a tortoise
shell and a dog leg. Builders have even constructed entire buildings using a 3D printer.

The technology and use of 3D printers depend on the ability to understand the language of algebra. Engineers must
be able to translate observations and needs in the natural world to complex mathematical commands that can provide
directions to a printer. In this chapter, you will review the language of algebra and take your first steps toward working
with algebraic concepts.

1.1 Use the Language of Algebra

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Find factors, prime factorizations, and least common multiples
Use variables and algebraic symbols
Simplify expressions using the order of operations
Evaluate an expression
Identify and combine like terms
Translate an English phrase to an algebraic expression

Be Prepared!

This chapter is intended to be a brief review of concepts that will be needed in an Intermediate Algebra course. A

Chapter 1 Foundations

Find Factors, Prime Factorizations, and Least Common Multiples

The numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 are called multiples of 2. A multiple of 2 can be written as the product of a counting number
and 2.

Similarly, a multiple of 3 would be the product of a counting number and 3.

We could find the multiples of any number by continuing this process.

Multiple of a Number

A number is a multiple of n if it is the product of a counting number and n.

Another way to say that 15 is a multiple of 3 is to say that 15 is divisible by 3. That means that when we divide 3 into 15,
we get a counting number. In fact, 15 ÷ 3 is 5, so 15 is 5 · 3.

Divisible by a Number

If a number m is a multiple of n, then m is divisible by n.

If we were to look for patterns in the multiples of the numbers 2 through 9, we would discover the following divisibility
tests:

Divisibility Tests

A number is divisible by:

2 if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.

5 if the last digit is 5 or 0.

6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

10 if it ends with 0.

Is 5,625 divisible by ⓐ 2? ⓑ 3? ⓒ 5 or 10? ⓓ 6?

Solution

ⓐ
Is 5,625 divisible by 2?

Does it end in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8?

No.
5,625 is not divisible by 2.

ⓑ
Is 5,625 divisible by 3?

What is the sum of the digits?
Is the sum divisible by 3?

ⓒ
Is 5,625 divisible by 5 or 10?

5 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 18
Yes.
5,625 is divisible by 3.

What is the last digit? It is 5.

5,625 is divisible by 5 but not by 10.

ⓓ
Is 5,625 divisible by 6?

Is it divisible by both 2 and 3?

No, 5,625 is not divisible by 2, so 5,625 is
not divisible by 6.

TRY IT : : 1.1

TRY IT : : 1.2

Is 4,962 divisible by ⓐ 2? ⓑ 3? ⓒ 5? ⓓ 6? ⓔ 10?

Is 3,765 divisible by ⓐ 2? ⓑ 3? ⓒ 5? ⓓ 6? ⓔ 10?

In mathematics, there are often several ways to talk about the same ideas. So far, we’ve seen that if m is a multiple of n,
we can say that m is divisible by n. For example, since 72 is a multiple of 8, we say 72 is divisible by 8. Since 72 is a multiple
of 9, we say 72 is divisible by 9. We can express this still another way.

Since 8 · 9 = 72, we say that 8 and 9 are factors of 72. When we write 72 = 8 · 9, we say we have factored 72.

Other ways to factor 72 are 1 · 72,
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.

2 · 36,

Factors

If a · b = m,

then a and b are factors of m.

3 · 24,

4 · 18,

and 6 · 12. The number 72 has many factors:

Some numbers, such as 72, have many factors. Other numbers have only two factors. A prime number is a counting
number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.

Prime number and Composite number

A prime number is a counting number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and the number itself.

A composite number is a counting number that is not prime. A composite number has factors other than 1 and the
number itself.

8

Chapter 1 Foundations

The counting numbers from 2 to 20 are listed in the table with their factors. Make sure to agree with the “prime” or
“composite” label for each!

The prime numbers less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Notice that the only even prime number is 2.

A composite number can be written as a unique product of primes. This is called the prime factorization of the number.
Finding the prime factorization of a composite number will be useful in many topics in this course.

Prime Factorization

The prime factorization of a number is the product of prime numbers that equals the number.

To find the prime factorization of a composite number, find any two factors of the number and use them to create two
branches. If a factor is prime, that branch is complete. Circle that prime. Otherwise it is easy to lose track of the prime
numbers.

If the factor is not prime, find two factors of the number and continue the process. Once all the branches have circled
primes at the end, the factorization is complete. The composite number can now be written as a product of prime
numbers.

We say 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 3 is the prime factorization of 48. We generally write the primes in ascending order. Be sure to multiply
the factors to verify your answer.

If we first factored 48 in a different way, for example as 6 · 8,
factorization and verify this for yourself.

the result would still be the same. Finish the prime

TRY IT : : 1.3

Find the prime factorization of 80.

TRY IT : : 1.4

Find the prime factorization of 60.

HOW TO : : FIND THE PRIME FACTORIZATION OF A COMPOSITE NUMBER.

Step 1.

Find two factors whose product is the given number, and use these numbers to create two
branches.

Step 2.

If a factor is prime, that branch is complete. Circle the prime, like a leaf on the tree.

Step 3.

If a factor is not prime, write it as the product of two factors and continue the process.

Step 4.

Write the composite number as the product of all the circled primes.

One of the reasons we look at primes is to use these techniques to find the least common multiple of two numbers. This
will be useful when we add and subtract fractions with different denominators.

Least Common Multiple

The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.

To find the least common multiple of two numbers we will use the Prime Factors Method. Let’s find the LCM of 12 and 18
using their prime factors.

EXAMPLE 1.3 HOW TO FIND THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE USING THE PRIME FACTORS METHOD

Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 18 using the prime factors method.

Solution

10

Chapter 1 Foundations

Notice that the prime factors of 12 (2 · 2 · 3) and the prime factors of 18 (2 · 3 · 3) are included in the LCM (2 · 2 · 3 · 3).
So 36 is the least common multiple of 12 and 18.

By matching up the common primes, each common prime factor is used only once. This way you are sure that 36 is the
least common multiple.

TRY IT : : 1.5

Find the LCM of 9 and 12 using the Prime Factors Method.

TRY IT : : 1.6

Find the LCM of 18 and 24 using the Prime Factors Method.

HOW TO : : FIND THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE USING THE PRIME FACTORS METHOD.

Step 1.

Write each number as a product of primes.

Step 2.

List the primes of each number. Match primes vertically when possible.

Step 3.

Bring down the columns.

Step 4.

Multiply the factors.

Use Variables and Algebraic Symbols

In algebra, we use a letter of the alphabet to represent a number whose value may change. We call this a variable and
letters commonly used for variables are x, y, a, b, c.

Variable

A variable is a letter that represents a number whose value may change.

A number whose value always remains the same is called a constant.

Constant

A constant is a number whose value always stays the same.

To write algebraically, we need some operation symbols as well as numbers and variables. There are several types of
symbols we will be using. There are four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
We’ll list the symbols used to indicate these operations below.

Operation Symbols

Operation

Notation

Say:

The result is…

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

a + b

a − b

a · b, ab, (a)(b),
(a)b, a(b)

a ÷ b, a/b, a
b

, b a

a plus b

the sum of a and b

a minus b

the difference of a and b

a times b

the product of a and b

a divided by
b

the quotient of a and b;
a is called the dividend, and b is called the
divisor

When two quantities have the same value, we say they are equal and connect them with an equal sign.

Chapter 1 Foundations

Equality Symbol

a = b is read “a is equal to b.”

The symbol “=” is called the equal sign.

11

On the number line, the numbers get larger as they go from left to right. The number line can be used to explain the
symbols “<” and “>”.

Inequality

The expressions a < b or a > b can be read from left to right or right to left, though in English we usually read from left
to right. In general,

a < b
a > b

is equivalent to b > a. For example, 7 < 11 is equivalent to 11 > 7.
is equivalent to b < a. For example, 17 > 4 is equivalent to 4 < 17.

Inequality Symbols

Inequality Symbols Words

a ≠ b

a < b

a ≤ b

a > b

a ≥ b

a is not equal to b.

a is less than b.

a is less than or equal to b.

a is greater than b.

a is greater than or equal to b.

Grouping symbols in algebra are much like the commas, colons, and other punctuation marks in English. They help
identify an expression, which can be made up of number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables using
operation symbols. We will introduce three types of grouping symbols now.

Grouping Symbols

Parentheses
Brackets
Braces

( )
[ ]
{ }

Here are some examples of expressions that include grouping symbols. We will simplify expressions like these later in this
section.

8(14 − 8)

21 − 3[2 + 4(9 − 8)]

24 ÷ ⎧

⎨13 − 2[1(6 − 5) + 4]⎫

⎬
⎭

⎩

What is the difference in English between a phrase and a sentence? A phrase expresses a single thought that is incomplete
by itself, but a sentence makes a complete statement. A sentence has a subject and a verb. In algebra, we have expressions
and equations.

Expression

An expression is a number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables using operation symbols.

12

Chapter 1 Foundations

Words
3 plus 5
n minus one

English Phrase
the sum of three and five
the difference of n and one
the product of six and seven

x divided by y

the quotient of x and y

Notice that the English phrases do not form a complete sentence because the phrase does not have a verb.

An equation is two expressions linked by an equal sign. When you read the words the symbols represent in an equation,
you have a complete sentence in English. The equal sign gives the verb.

Equation

An equation is two expressions connected by an equal sign.

Equation
3 + 5 = 8
n − 1 = 14
6 · 7 = 42
x = 53
y + 9 = 2y − 3

English Sentence
The sum of three and five is equal to eight.
n minus one equals fourteen.
The product of six and seven is equal to forty-two.
x is equal to fifty-three.
y plus nine is equal to two y minus three.

Suppose we need to multiply 2 nine times. We could write this as 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2. This is tedious and it can be
hard to keep track of all those 2s, so we use exponents. We write 2 · 2 · 2 as 23 and 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 as 29. In
expressions such as 23,
the 2 is called the base and the 3 is called the exponent. The exponent tells us how many times
we need to multiply the base.

Exponential Notation

We say 23 is in exponential notation and 2 · 2 · 2 is in expanded notation.
an means multiply a by itself, n times.

The expression an is read a to the nth power.

While we read an as “a to the nth power”, we usually read:

a2
a3
We’ll see later why a2 and a3 have special names.
Table 1.1 shows how we read some expressions with exponents.

“a squared”

“a cubed”

Simplify Expressions Using the Order of Operations

To simplify an expression means to do all the math possible. For example, to simplify 4 · 2 + 1 we would first multiply
4 · 2 to get 8 and then add the 1 to get 9. A good habit to develop is to work down the page, writing each step of the
process below the previous step. The example just described would look like this:

4 · 2 + 1
8 + 1
9

By not using an equal sign when you simplify an expression, you may avoid confusing expressions with equations.

Simplify an Expression

To simplify an expression, do all operations in the expression.

We’ve introduced most of the symbols and notation used in algebra, but now we need to clarify the order of operations.
Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in different values.

For example, consider the expression 4 + 3 · 7. Some students simplify this getting 49, by adding 4 + 3 and then
multiplying that result by 7. Others get 25, by multiplying 3 · 7 first and then adding 4.

The same expression should give the same result. So mathematicians established some guidelines that are called the
order of operations.

HOW TO : : USE THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS.

Step 1.

Parentheses and Other Grouping Symbols

◦ Simplify all expressions inside the parentheses or other grouping symbols, working on

the innermost parentheses first.

Step 2.

Exponents

◦ Simplify all expressions with exponents.

Step 3.

Multiplication and Division

◦ Perform all multiplication and division in order from left to right. These operations

have equal priority.

Step 4.

Addition and Subtraction

◦ Perform all addition and subtraction in order from left to right. These operations have

equal priority.

Students often ask, “How will I remember the order?” Here is a way to help you remember: Take the first letter of each
key word and substitute the silly phrase “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally”.

Parentheses
Exponents
Multiplication Division
Addition Subtraction

Please
Excuse
My Dear
Aunt Sally

It’s good that “My Dear” goes together, as this reminds us that multiplication and division have equal priority. We do not
always do multiplication before division or always do division before multiplication. We do them in order from left to right.

14

Chapter 1 Foundations

Similarly, “Aunt Sally” goes together and so reminds us that addition and subtraction also have equal priority and we do
them in order from left to right.

EXAMPLE 1.4

Simplify: 18 ÷ 6 + 4(5 − 2).

Solution

Parentheses? Yes, subtract first.

Exponents? No.

Multiplication or division? Yes.

Divide first because we multiply and divide left to right.

Any other multiplication or division? Yes.

Multiply.

Any other multiplication of division? No.

Any addition or subtraction? Yes.

Add.

TRY IT : : 1.7

Simplify: 30 ÷ 5 + 10(3 − 2).

TRY IT : : 1.8

Simplify: 70 ÷ 10 + 4(6 − 2).

When there are multiple grouping symbols, we simplify the innermost parentheses first and work outward.

EXAMPLE 1.5

Simplify: 5 + 23 + 3⎡

⎣6 − 3(4 − 2)⎤
⎦.

Solution

Are there any parentheses (or other
grouping symbols)? Yes.

Focus on the parentheses that are inside the
brackets. Subtract.

Continue inside the brackets and multiply.

Continue inside the brackets and subtract.

The expression inside the brackets requires
no further simplification.

Evaluate an Expression

In the last few examples, we simplified expressions using the order of operations. Now we’ll evaluate some
expressions—again following the order of operations. To evaluate an expression means to find the value of the
expression when the variable is replaced by a given number.

Evaluate an Expression

To evaluate an expression means to find the value of the expression when the variable is replaced by a given
number.

To evaluate an expression, substitute that number for the variable in the expression and then simplify the expression.

Identify and Combine Like Terms

Algebraic expressions are made up of terms. A term is a constant, or the product of a constant and one or more variables.

Term

A term is a constant or the product of a constant and one or more variables.

Examples of terms are 7, y, 5x2, 9a, and b5.

The constant that multiplies the variable is called the coefficient.

Coefficient

The coefficient of a term is the constant that multiplies the variable in a term.

Think of the coefficient as the number in front of the variable. The coefficient of the term 3x is 3. When we write x,
coefficient is 1, since x = 1 · x.

the

Some terms share common traits. When two terms are constants or have the same variable and exponent, we say they
are like terms.

Look at the following 6 terms. Which ones seem to have traits in common?

5x

7

n2

4

3x

9n2

We say,

7 and 4 are like terms.

5x and 3x are like terms.

n2 and 9n2 are like terms.

Like Terms

Terms that are either constants or have the same variables raised to the same powers are called like terms.

If there are like terms in an expression, you can simplify the expression by combining the like terms. We add the
coefficients and keep the same variable.

Simplify.
Add the coefficients.

4x + 7x + x
12x

EXAMPLE 1.7 HOW TO COMBINE LIKE TERMS

Step 2.

Rearrange the expression so like terms are together.

Step 3.

Add or subtract the coefficients and keep the same variable for each group of like terms.

Translate an English Phrase to an Algebraic Expression

We listed many operation symbols that are used in algebra. Now, we will use them to translate English phrases into
algebraic expressions. The symbols and variables we’ve talked about will help us do that. Table 1.2 summarizes them.

Look closely at these phrases using the four operations:

Each phrase tells us to operate on two numbers. Look for the words of and and to find the numbers.

EXAMPLE 1.8

ⓐ the difference of 14x and 9
ⓑ the quotient of 8y2 and 3
ⓒ twelve more than y
ⓓ seven less than 49x2

Solution

ⓐ The key word is difference, which tells us the operation is subtraction. Look for the words of and and to find the numbers
to subtract.

ⓑ The key word is quotient, which tells us the operation is division.

ⓒ The key words are more than. They tell us the operation is addition. More than means “added to.”

twelve more than y

Translate the English phrase into an algebraic expression:

ⓐ the sum of 17y2 and 19
ⓑ the product of 7 and y
ⓒ Eleven more than x
ⓓ Fourteen less than 11a

We look carefully at the words to help us distinguish between multiplying a sum and adding a product.

EXAMPLE 1.9

Translate the English phrase into an algebraic expression:

ⓐ eight times the sum of x and y
ⓑ the sum of eight times x and y

Solution

There are two operation words—times tells us to multiply and sum tells us to add.

ⓐ Because we are multiplying 8 times the sum, we need parentheses around the sum of x and y, (x + y). This forces us
to determine the sum first. (Remember the order of operations.)

eight times the sum of x and y
8(x + y)

ⓑ To take a sum, we look for the words of and and to see what is being added. Here we are taking the sum of eight times
x and y.

phrase to an algebraic expression. We’ll see how to do this in the next two examples.

Simplify Expressions with Absolute Value

A negative number is a number less than 0. The negative numbers are to the left of zero on the number line. See Figure
1.2.

Figure 1.2 The number line shows the location of
positive and negative numbers.

You may have noticed that, on the number line, the negative numbers are a mirror image of the positive numbers, with
zero in the middle. Because the numbers 2 and −2 are the same distance from zero, each one is called the opposite of
the other. The opposite of 2 is −2, and the opposite of −2 is 2.

Opposite

The opposite of a number is the number that is the same distance from zero on the number line but on the opposite
side of zero.

Figure 1.3 illustrates the definition.

Figure 1.3 The opposite of 3 is −3 .

Opposite Notation

−a means the opposite of the number a

The notation −a is read as “the opposite of a.”

We saw that numbers such as 3 and −3 are opposites because they are the same distance from 0 on the number line.
They are both three units from 0. The distance between 0 and any number on the number line is called the absolute value
of that number.

Absolute Value

The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line.

The absolute value of a number n is written as |n| and |n| ≥ 0 for all numbers.

Absolute values are always greater than or equal to zero.

For example,

Figure 1.4 illustrates this idea.

−5 is 5 units away from 0, so |−5| = 5.
5 is 5 units away from 0, so |5| = 5.

Figure 1.4 The numbers 5 and −5 are 5 units
away from 0.

The absolute value of a number is never negative because distance cannot be negative. The only number with absolute
value equal to zero is the number zero itself because the distance from 0 to 0 on the number line is zero units.

In the next example, we’ll order expressions with absolute values.

We now add absolute value bars to our list of grouping symbols. When we use the order of operations, first we simplify
inside the absolute value bars as much as possible, then we take the absolute value of the resulting number.

Add and Subtract Integers

So far, we have only used the counting numbers and the whole numbers.

1, 2, 3 …
0, 1, 2, 3….

Our work with opposites gives us a way to define the integers. The whole numbers and their opposites are called the

… −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3…,

Most students are comfortable with the addition and subtraction facts for positive numbers. But doing addition or
subtraction with both positive and negative numbers may be more challenging.

We will use two color counters to model addition and subtraction of negatives so that you can visualize the procedures
instead of memorizing the rules.

We let one color (blue) represent positive. The other color (red) will represent the negatives.

If we have one positive counter and one negative counter, the value of the pair is zero. They form a neutral pair. The value
of this neutral pair is zero.

Chapter 1 Foundations

27

We will use the counters to show how to add:

5 + 3

−5 + (−3)

−5 + 3

5 + (−3)

The first example, 5 + 3, adds 5 positives and 3 positives—both positives.

The second example, −5 + (−3), adds 5 negatives and 3 negatives—both negatives.

When the signs are the same, the counters are all the same color, and so we add them. In each case we get 8—either 8
positives or 8 negatives.

So what happens when the signs are different? Let’s add −5 + 3 and 5 + (−3).

When we use counters to model addition of positive and negative integers, it is easy to see whether there are more
positive or more negative counters. So we know whether the sum will be positive or negative.

EXAMPLE 1.14

Add: ⓐ −1 + (−4) ⓑ −1 + 5 ⓒ 1 + (−5).

Solution

ⓐ

1 negative plus 4 negatives is 5 negatives

ⓑ

There are more positives, so the sum is positive.

Add: ⓐ −2 + (−4) ⓑ −2 + 4 ⓒ 2 + (−4).

TRY IT : : 1.28

Add: ⓐ −2 + (−5) ⓑ −2 + 5 ⓒ 2 + (−5).

We will continue to use counters to model the subtraction. Perhaps when you were younger, you read “5 − 3” as “5 take
away 3.” When you use counters, you can think of subtraction the same way!

We will use the counters to show to subtract:

5 − 3

−5 − (−3)

−5 − 3

5 − (−3)

The first example, 5 − 3, we subtract 3 positives from 5 positives and end up with 2 positives.

In the second example, −5 − (−3), we subtract 3 negatives from 5 negatives and end up with 2 negatives.

Each example used counters of only one color, and the “take away” model of subtraction was easy to apply.

What happens when we have to subtract one positive and one negative number? We’ll need to use both blue and red
counters as well as some neutral pairs. If we don’t have the number of counters needed to take away, we add neutral
pairs. Adding a neutral pair does not change the value. It is like changing quarters to nickels—the value is the same, but
it looks different.

Let’s look at −5 − 3 and 5 − (−3).

We now add the

Chapter 1 Foundations

Have you noticed that subtraction of signed numbers can be done by adding the opposite? In the last example, −3 − 1 is the
same as −3 + (−1) and 3 − (−1) is the same as 3 + 1. You will often see this idea, the Subtraction Property, written
as follows:

Multiply and Divide Integers

Since multiplication is mathematical shorthand for repeated addition, our model can easily be applied to show
multiplication of integers. Let’s look at this concrete model to see what patterns we notice. We will use the same examples
that we used for addition and subtraction. Here, we are using the model just to help us discover the pattern.

We remember that a · b means add a, b times.

The next two examples are more interesting. What does it mean to multiply 5 by −3 ? It means subtract 5, 3 times.
Looking at subtraction as “taking away”, it means to take away 5, 3 times. But there is nothing to take away, so we start
by adding neutral pairs on the workspace.

In summary:

5 · 3 = 15
5(−3) = −15

−5(3) = −15
(−5)(−3) = 15

Notice that for multiplication of two signed numbers, when the

signs are the same, the product is positive.
signs are different, the product is negative.

What about division? Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. So, 15 ÷ 3 = 5 because 5 · 3 = 15. In words,
this expression says that 15 can be divided into 3 groups of 5 each because adding five three times gives 15. If you look at
some examples of multiplying integers, you might figure out the rules for dividing integers.

32

Chapter 1 Foundations

5 · 3 = 15
(−5)(−3) = 15 so 15 ÷ (−3) = −5

so 15 ÷ 3 = 5

−5(3) = −15 so −15 ÷ 3 = −5
5(−3) = −15 so −15 ÷ (−3) = 5

Division follows the same rules as multiplication with regard to signs.

Multiplication and Division of Signed Numbers

For multiplication and division of two signed numbers:

• Two positives

Positive

• Two negatives

If the signs are the same, the result is positive.

opposite!

−1a = −a

What happens when there are more than two numbers in an expression? The order of operations still applies when
negatives are included. Remember Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally?

Let’s try some examples. We’ll simplify expressions that use all four operations with integers—addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. Remember to follow the order of operations.

EXAMPLE 1.19

Simplify: ⓐ (−2)4 ⓑ −24.

Solution

Notice the difference in parts (a) and (b). In part (a), the exponent means to raise what is in the parentheses, the −2 to
the 4th power. In part (b), the exponent means to raise just the 2 to the 4th power and then take the opposite.

to call it! So when we solve an application, we first need to determine what the problem is asking us to find. Then we’ll
write a phrase that gives the information to find it. We’ll translate the phrase into an expression and then simplify the
expression to get the answer. Finally, we summarize the answer in a sentence to make sure it makes sense.

Simplify Fractions

A fraction is a way to represent parts of a whole. The fraction 2
3

represents two of three equal parts. See Figure 1.5. In

the fraction 2
3

,

the 2 is called the numerator and the 3 is called the denominator. The line is called the fraction bar.

Figure 1.5 In the circle, 2
3

of the circle is

shaded—2 of the 3 equal parts.

Fraction

A fraction is written a
b

, where b ≠ 0 and

a is the numerator and b is the denominator.

A fraction represents parts of a whole. The denominator b is the number of equal parts the whole has been divided
into, and the numerator a indicates how many parts are included.

Fractions that have the same value are equivalent fractions. The Equivalent Fractions

Property allows us to find equivalent fractions and also simplify fractions.

Equivalent Fractions Property

If a, b, and c are numbers where b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0,

then a
b

= a · c
b · c

and a · c
b · c

= a
b

.

A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator.

For example,

2
3

is simplified because there are no common factors of 2 and 3.

10
15

is not simplified because 5 is a common factor of 10 and 15.

We simplify, or reduce, a fraction by removing the common factors of the numerator and denominator. A fraction is not
simplified until all common factors have been removed. If an expression has fractions, it is not completely simplified until
the fractions are simplified.

42

Chapter 1 Foundations

Sometimes it may not be easy to find common factors of the numerator and denominator. When this happens, a good
idea is to factor the numerator and the denominator into prime numbers. Then divide out the common factors using the
Equivalent Fractions Property.

We now summarize the steps you should follow to simplify fractions.

HOW TO : : SIMPLIFY A FRACTION.

Step 1.

Rewrite the numerator and denominator to show the common factors.
If needed, factor the numerator and denominator into prime numbers first.

Step 2.

Simplify using the Equivalent Fractions Property by dividing out common factors.

Step 3.

Multiply any remaining factors.

Multiply and Divide Fractions

Many people find multiplying and dividing fractions easier than adding and subtracting fractions.

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.

Fraction Multiplication

If a, b, c, and d are numbers where b ≠ 0, and d ≠ 0,

then

a
b

· c
d

= ac
bd

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.

When multiplying fractions, the properties of positive and negative numbers still apply, of course. It is a good idea to
determine the sign of the product as the first step. In Example 1.25, we will multiply negative and a positive, so the
product will be negative.

When multiplying a fraction by an integer, it may be helpful to write the integer as a fraction. Any integer, a, can be written
as a
1

. So, for example, 3 = 3
1

EXAMPLE 1.25

Multiply: − 12

(−20x).

Solution

The first step is to find the sign of the product. Since the signs are the same, the product is positive.

Determine the sign of the product. The signs
are the same, so the product is positive.

Write 20x as a fraction.

Multiply.

Rewrite 20 to show the common factor 5
and divide it out.

Now that we know how to multiply fractions, we are almost ready to divide. Before we can do that, we need some
vocabulary. The reciprocal of a fraction is found by inverting the fraction, placing the numerator in the denominator and
the denominator in the numerator. The reciprocal of 2
3

. Since 4 is written in fraction form as 4
1

the reciprocal of 4

is 3
2

,

is 1

.

To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.

Fraction Division

If a, b, c, and d are numbers where b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0, and d ≠ 0,

then

To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.

We need to say b ≠ 0,

c ≠ 0, and d ≠ 0,

to be sure we don’t divide by zero!

The numerators or denominators of some fractions contain fractions themselves. A fraction in which the numerator or
the denominator is a fraction is called a complex fraction.

Complex Fraction

A complex fraction is a fraction in which the numerator or the denominator contains a fraction.

Some examples of complex fractions are:

6
7
3

3
4
5
8

x

To simplify a complex fraction, remember that the fraction bar means division. For example, the complex fraction

When we multiplied fractions, we just multiplied the numerators and multiplied the denominators right straight across.
To add or subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator.

Fraction Addition and Subtraction

If a, b, and c are numbers where c ≠ 0,

then

c + b
a

c = a + b
c

and a

c − b

c = a − b
c

To add or subtract fractions, add or subtract the numerators and place the result over the common denominator.

The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the smallest number that can be used as a common
denominator of the fractions. The LCD of the two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators.

Least Common Denominator

The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators.

After we find the least common denominator of two fractions, we convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the
LCD. Putting these steps together allows us to add and subtract fractions because their denominators will be the same!

Use the Order of Operations to Simplify Fractions

The fraction bar in a fraction acts as grouping symbol. The order of operations then tells us to simplify the numerator and
then the denominator. Then we divide.

HOW TO : : SIMPLIFY AN EXPRESSION WITH A FRACTION BAR.

Step 1.

Simplify the expression in the numerator. Simplify the expression in the denominator.

Step 2.

Simplify the fraction.

Where does the negative sign go in a fraction? Usually the negative sign is in front of the fraction, but you will sometimes
see a fraction with a negative numerator, or sometimes with a negative denominator. Remember that fractions represent
division. When the numerator and denominator have different signs, the quotient is negative.

EXAMPLE 1.30

Simplify: 4(−3) + 6(−2)

−3(2) − 2

.

Solution

The fraction bar acts like a grouping symbol. So completely simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.

.

Now we’ll look at complex fractions where the numerator or denominator contains an expression that can be simplified.
So we first must completely simplify the numerator and denominator separately using the order of operations. Then we
divide the numerator by the denominator as the fraction bar means division.

Round Decimals

Decimals are another way of writing fractions whose denominators are powers of ten.

is “one tenth”

is “one hundredth”

is “one thousandth”

is “one ten-thousandth”

Just as in whole numbers, each digit of a decimal corresponds to the place value based on the powers of ten. Figure 1.6
shows the names of the place values to the left and right of the decimal point.

Figure 1.6

When we work with decimals, it is often necessary to round the number to the nearest required place value. We
summarize the steps for rounding a decimal here.

56

Chapter 1 Foundations

HOW TO : : ROUND DECIMALS.

Step 1.

Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow.

Step 2.

Underline the digit to the right of the place value.

Step 3.

Is the underlined digit greater than or equal to 5?

◦ Yes: add 1 to the digit in the given place value.

◦ No: do not change the digit in the given place value

Step 4.

Rewrite the number, deleting all digits to the right of the rounding digit.

EXAMPLE 1.34

Round 18.379 to the nearest ⓐ hundredth ⓑ tenth ⓒ whole number.

Solution

Round 18.379.

ⓐ to the nearest hundredth

Locate the hundredths place with an arrow.

Underline the digit to the right of the given
place value.

Because 9 is greater than or equal to 5, add 1 to
the 7.

Rewrite the number, deleting all digits to the
right of the rounding digit.

Notice that the deleted digits were NOT
replaced with zeros.

ⓑ to the nearest tenth

Locate the tenths place with an arrow.

Underline the digit to the right of the
given place value.

Because 7 is greater than or equal to 5,
add 1 to the 3.

Rewrite the number, deleting all digits to
the right of the rounding digit.

Round 15.2175 to the nearest ⓐ thousandth ⓑ hundredth ⓒ tenth.

Add and Subtract Decimals

To add or subtract decimals, we line up the decimal points. By lining up the decimal points this way, we can add or subtract
the corresponding place values. We then add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers and then place the
decimal point in the sum.

HOW TO : : ADD OR SUBTRACT DECIMALS.

Step 1.

Determine the sign of the sum or difference.

Step 2.

Write the numbers so the decimal points line up vertically.

Step 3.

Use zeros as placeholders, as needed.

Step 4.

Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Then place the
decimal point in the answer under the decimal points in the given numbers.

Step 5.

Write the sum or difference with the appropriate sign.

EXAMPLE 1.35

Add or subtract: ⓐ −23.5 − 41.38 ⓑ 14.65 − 20.

Solution

ⓐ

58

Chapter 1 Foundations

The difference will be negative. To subtract, we add the
numerals. Write the numbers so the decimal points line
up vertically.

Put 0 as a placeholder after the 5 in 23.5.

14.65 − 20

The difference will be negative. To subtract, we
subtract 14.65 from 20.

Write the numbers so the decimal points line up
vertically.

Multiply and Divide Decimals

When we multiply signed decimals, first we determine the sign of the product and then multiply as if the numbers were
both positive. We multiply the numbers temporarily ignoring the decimal point and then count the number of decimal
points in the factors and that sum tells us the number of decimal places in the product. Finally, we write the product with
the appropriate sign.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5

Chapter 1 Foundations

59

HOW TO : : MULTIPLY DECIMALS.

Step 1.

Determine the sign of the product.

Step 2.

Step 3.

Write in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right. Multiply the numbers as if they
were whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal points.

Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of
the number of decimal places in the factors.

Step 4.

Write the product with the appropriate sign.

EXAMPLE 1.36

Multiply: (−3.9)(4.075).

Solution

The signs are different. The product
will be negative.

The product will be negative.

(−3.9)(4.075)

Write in vertical format, lining up the
numbers on the right.

Multiply.

Add the number of decimal places in
the factors (1 + 3).
Place the decimal point 4 places from the right.

The signs are the different, so the product is negative.

(−3.9)(4.075) = −15.8925

TRY IT : : 1.71

Multiply: −4.5(6.107).

TRY IT : : 1.72

Multiply: −10.79(8.12).

Often, especially in the sciences, you will multiply decimals by powers of 10 (10, 100, 1000, etc). If you multiply a few
products on paper, you may notice a pattern relating the number of zeros in the power of 10 to number of decimal places
we move the decimal point to the right to get the product.

60

Chapter 1 Foundations

HOW TO : : MULTIPLY A DECIMAL BY A POWER OF TEN.

Step 1.

Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places as the
number of zeros in the power of 10.

Step 2.

Add zeros at the end of the number as needed.

EXAMPLE 1.37

Multiply: 5.63 by ⓐ 10 ⓑ 100 ⓒ 1000.

Solution

By looking at the number of zeros in the multiple of ten, we see the number of places we need to move the decimal to the
right.

ⓐ

There is 1 zero in 10, so move the decimal point 1 place to the right.

ⓑ

There are 2 zeroes in 100, so move the decimal point 2 places to the right.

ⓒ

There are 3 zeroes in 1,000, so move the decimal point 3 place to the right.

A zero must be added to the end.

TRY IT : : 1.73

Multiply 2.58 by ⓐ 10 ⓑ 100 ⓒ 1000.

TRY IT : : 1.74

Multiply 14.2 by ⓐ 10 ⓑ 100 ⓒ 1000.

Just as with multiplication, division of signed decimals is very much like dividing whole numbers. We just have to figure out
where the decimal point must be placed and the sign of the quotient. When dividing signed decimals, first determine the
sign of the quotient and then divide as if the numbers were both positive. Finally, write the quotient with the appropriate
sign.

We review the notation and vocabulary for division:

We’ll write the steps to take when dividing decimals for easy reference.

HOW TO : : DIVIDE DECIMALS.

Step 1.

Determine the sign of the quotient.

Step 2.

Make the divisor a whole number by “moving” the decimal point all the way to the right.
“Move” the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places—adding zeros as
needed.

Step 3.

Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend.

Step 4.

Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.

EXAMPLE 1.38

Divide: −25.65 ÷ (−0.06).

Solution

Remember, you can “move” the decimals in the divisor and dividend because of the Equivalent Fractions Property.

The signs are the same.

The quotient is positive.

Make the divisor a whole number by “moving” the
decimal point all the way to the right.

“Move” the decimal point in the dividend the same
number of places.

Divide.
Place the decimal point in the quotient above the
decimal point in the dividend.

Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.

TRY IT : : 1.75

Divide: −23.492 ÷ (−0.04).

TRY IT : : 1.76

Divide: −4.11 ÷ (−0.12).

Convert Decimals, Fractions, and Percents

In our work, it is often necessary to change the form of a number. We may have to change fractions to decimals or
decimals to percent.

We convert decimals into fractions by identifying the place value of the last (farthest right) digit. In the decimal 0.03. the
3 is in the hundredths place, so 100 is the denominator of the fraction equivalent to 0.03.

The steps to take to convert a decimal to a fraction are summarized in the procedure box.

0.03 = 3
100

62

Chapter 1 Foundations

HOW TO : : CONVERT A DECIMAL TO A PROPER FRACTION AND A FRACTION TO A DECIMAL.

Step 1.

To convert a decimal to a proper fraction, determine the place value of the final digit.

Step 2.

Write the fraction.

◦ numerator—the “numbers” to the right of the decimal point

◦ denominator—the place value corresponding to the final digit

Step 3.

To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator of
the fraction.

EXAMPLE 1.39

Write: ⓐ 0.374 as a fraction ⓑ − 5
8

as a decimal.

Solution

ⓐ

Determine the place value of the final digit.

Write the fraction for 0.374:
The numerator is 374.
The denominator is 1,000.

Simplify the fraction.

Divide out the common factors.

ⓑ Since a fraction bar means division, we begin by writing the fraction 5
8

as 8 5. Now divide.

TRY IT : : 1.77

Write: ⓐ 0.234 as a fraction ⓑ − 7
8

as a decimal.

TRY IT : : 1.78

Write: ⓐ 0.024 as a fraction ⓑ − 3
8

as a decimal.

A percent is a ratio whose denominator is 100. Percent means per hundred. We use the percent symbol, %, to show
percent. Since a percent is a ratio, it can easily be expressed as a fraction. Percent means per 100, so the denominator of
the fraction is 100. We then change the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. After doing
this many times, you may see the pattern.

Chapter 1 Foundations

63

To convert a percent number to a decimal number, we move the decimal point two places to the left.

To convert a decimal to a percent, remember that percent means per hundred. If we change the decimal to a fraction
whose denominator is 100, it is easy to change that fraction to a percent. After many conversions, you may recognize the
pattern.

To convert a decimal to a percent, we move the decimal point two places to the right and then add the percent sign.

HOW TO : : CONVERT A PERCENT TO A DECIMAL AND A DECIMAL TO A PERCENT.

Step 1.

Step 2.

To convert a percent to a decimal, move the decimal point two places to the left after removing
the percent sign.

To convert a decimal to a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right and then add
the percent sign.

EXAMPLE 1.40

Convert each:

ⓐ percent to a decimal: 62%, 135%, and 13.7%.

ⓑ decimal to a percent: 0.51, 1.25, and 0.093.

Move the decimal point two places to the left.

ⓑ

Move the decimal point two places to the right.

Chapter 1 Foundations

Simplify Expressions with Square Roots
Remember that when a number n is multiplied by itself, we write n2 and read it “ n squared.” The result is called the
square of a number n. For example, 82 is read “8 squared” and 64 is called the square of 8. Similarly, 121 is the square
of 11 because 112 is 121. It will be helpful to learn to recognize the perfect square numbers.

Square of a number

If n2 = m,

then m is the square of n.

What about the squares of negative numbers? We know that when the signs of two numbers are the same, their product
is positive. So the square of any negative number is also positive.

(−3)2 = 9

(−8)2 = 64

(−11)2 = 121

(−15)2 = 225

Because 102 = 100, we say 100 is the square of 10. We also say that 10 is a square root of 100. A number whose square
is m is called a square root of a number m.

Square Root of a Number

If n2 = m,

then n is a square root of m.

Notice (−10)2 = 100 also, so −10 is also a square root of 100. Therefore, both 10 and −10 are square roots of 100. So,
every positive number has two square roots—one positive and one negative. The radical sign, m , denotes the positive
square root. The positive square root is called the principal square root. When we use the radical sign that always means
we want the principal square root.

Square Root Notation

m is read “the square root of m .”

If m = n2,

then m = n,

for n ≥ 0.

The square root of m, m,

is the positive number whose square is m.

We know that every positive number has two square roots and the radical sign indicates the positive one. We write
100 = 10. If we want to find the negative square root of a number, we place a negative in front of the radical sign. For

example, − 100 = −10. We read − 100 as “the opposite of the principal square root of 10.”

Identify Integers, Rational Numbers, Irrational Numbers, and Real Numbers

We have already described numbers as counting numbers, whole numbers, and integers. What is the difference between
these types of numbers? Difference could be confused with subtraction. How about asking how we distinguish between
these types of numbers?

Counting numbers
Whole numbers
Integers

1, 2, 3, 4, …..
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ….

…. − 3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ….

What type of numbers would we get if we started with all the integers and then included all the fractions? The numbers
we would have form the set of rational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be written as a ratio of two
integers.

In general, any decimal that ends after a number of digits (such as 7.3 or −1.2684 ) is a rational number. We can use
the place value of the last digit as the denominator when writing the decimal as a fraction. The decimal for 1

in calculus. The number(s) under the bar is called the repeating block and it repeats continuously.

. The bar over the 3 indicates that the number 3 repeats infinitely. Continuously has an important meaning

is the

Since all integers can be written as a fraction whose denominator is 1, the integers (and so also the counting and whole
numbers. are rational numbers.
Every rational number can be written both as a ratio of integers p

q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0, and as a decimal

that stops or repeats.

Rational Number

A rational number is a number of the form p

q , where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.

Its decimal form stops or repeats.

Are there any decimals that do not stop or repeat? Yes! The number π (the Greek letter pi, pronounced “pie”), which is
very important in describing circles, has a decimal form that does not stop or repeat. We use three dots (…) to indicate
the decimal does not stop or repeat.

The square root of a number that is not a perfect square is a decimal that does not stop or repeat.

A numbers whose decimal form does not stop or repeat cannot be written as a fraction of integers. We call this an
irrational number.

π = 3.141592654...

Irrational Number

An irrational number is a number that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers.

Its decimal form does not stop and does not repeat.

Let’s summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is rational or irrational.

Rational or Irrational

If the decimal form of a number

•

repeats or stops, the number is a rational number.

• does not repeat and does not stop, the number is an irrational number.

66

Chapter 1 Foundations

We have seen that all counting numbers are whole numbers, all whole numbers are integers, and all integers are rational
numbers. The irrational numbers are numbers whose decimal form does not stop and does not repeat. When we put
together the rational numbers and the irrational numbers, we get the set of real numbers.

Real Number

A real number is a number that is either rational or irrational.

Later in this course we will introduce numbers beyond the real numbers. Figure 1.7 illustrates how the number sets we’ve
used so far fit together.

Figure 1.7 This chart shows the number sets that
make up the set of real numbers.

Does the term “real numbers” seem strange to you? Are there any numbers that are not “real,” and, if so, what could they
be? Can we simplify −25 ? Is there a number whose square is −25 ?

( )2 = −25 ?

None of the numbers that we have dealt with so far has a square that is −25. Why? Any positive number squared is
positive. Any negative number squared is positive. So we say there is no real number equal to −25. The square root of
a negative number is not a real number.

ⓐ Remember, the whole numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, …, so 8 is the only whole number given.

ⓑ The integers are the whole numbers and their opposites (which includes 0). So the whole number 8 is an integer, and
−7 is the opposite of a whole number so it is an integer, too. Also, notice that 64 is the square of 8 so − 64 = −8. So
the integers are −7, 8, and − 64.

1.5 Properties of Real Numbers

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Use the commutative and associative properties
Use the properties of identity, inverse, and zero
Simplify expressions using the Distributive Property

Be Prepared!

A more thorough introduction to the topics covered in this section can be found in the Elementary Algebra chapter,
Foundations.

Use the Commutative and Associative Properties

The order we add two numbers doesn’t affect the result. If we add 8 + 9 or 9 + 8,
equal 17. So, 8 + 9 = 9 + 8. The order in which we add does not matter!

the results are the same—they both

Similarly, when multiplying two numbers, the order does not affect the result. If we multiply 9 · 8 or 8 · 9 the results are
the same—they both equal 72. So, 9 · 8 = 8 · 9. The order in which we multiply does not matter!

These examples illustrate the Commutative Property.

Commutative Property

of Addition
of Multiplication

If a and b are real numbers, then
If a and b are real numbers, then

a + b = b + a.
a · b = b · a.

When adding or multiplying, changing the order gives the same result.

The Commutative Property has to do with order. We subtract 9 − 8 and 8 − 9 , and see that 9 − 8 ≠ 8 − 9. Since
changing the order of the subtraction does not give the same result, we know that subtraction is not commutative.

Division is not commutative either. Since 12 ÷ 3 ≠ 3 ÷ 12, changing the order of the division did not give the same result.
The commutative properties apply only to addition and multiplication!

Addition and multiplication are commutative.

Subtraction and division are not commutative.

When adding three numbers, changing the grouping of
(7 + 8) + 2 = 7 + (8 + 2), since each side of the equation equals 17.

the numbers gives the same result. For example,

This is true for multiplication, too. For example,

⎛
⎝5 · 1
3

⎞
⎠ · 3 = 5 ·

⎛
⎝

1
3

⎞
⎠, since each side of the equation equals 5.

· 3

These examples illustrate the Associative Property.

Associative Property

of Addition
of Multiplication

If a, b, and c are real numbers, then
If a, b, and c are real numbers, then

(a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
(a · b) · c = a · (b · c).

When adding or multiplying, changing the grouping gives the same result.

The Associative Property has to do with grouping. If we change how the numbers are grouped, the result will be the same.
Notice it is the same three numbers in the same order—the only difference is the grouping.

We saw that subtraction and division were not commutative. They are not associative either.

(10 − 3) − 2 ≠ 10 − (3 − 2)
7 − 2 ≠ 10 − 1

(24 ÷ 4) ÷ 2 ≠ 24 ÷ (4 ÷ 2)
6 ÷ 2 ≠ 24 ÷ 2

5 ≠ 9

3 ≠ 12

When simplifying an expression, it is always a good idea to plan what the steps will be. In order to combine like terms in
the next example, we will use the Commutative Property of addition to write the like terms together.

EXAMPLE 1.45

Simplify: 18p + 6q + 15p + 5q.

Solution

Use the Commutative Property of addition to
reorder so that like terms are together.
Add like terms.

18p + 6q + 15p + 5q
18p + 15p + 6q + 5q

33p + 11q

Simplify: 23r + 14s + 9r + 15s.

TRY IT : : 1.90

Simplify: 37m + 21n + 4m − 15n.

When we have to simplify algebraic expressions, we can often make the work easier by applying the Commutative
Property or Associative Property first.

Use the Properties of Identity, Inverse, and Zero

What happens when we add 0 to any number? Adding 0 doesn’t change the value. For this reason, we call 0 the additive
identity. The Identity Property of Addition that states that for any real number a, a + 0 = a and 0 + a = a.

What happens when we multiply any number by one? Multiplying by 1 doesn’t change the value. So we call 1 the
multiplicative identity. The Identity Property of Multiplication that states that for any real number a, a · 1 = a and
1 · a = a.

We summarize the Identity Properties here.

74

Chapter 1 Foundations

Identity Property

of Addition For any real number a : a + 0 = a

0 is the additive identity

0 + a = a

of Multiplication For any real number a : a · 1 = a

1 is the multiplicative identity

1 · a = a

What number added to 5 gives the additive identity, 0? We know

The missing number was the opposite of the number!

We call −a the additive inverse of a. The opposite of a number is its additive inverse. A number and its opposite add
to zero, which is the additive identity. This leads to the Inverse Property of Addition that states for any real number
a, a + (−a) = 0.

What number multiplied by 2
3

gives the multiplicative identity, 1? In other words, 2
3

times what results in 1? We know

The missing number was the reciprocal of the number!

We call 1

a the multiplicative inverse of a. The reciprocal of a number is its multiplicative inverse. This leads to the Inverse

Property of Multiplication that states that for any real number a, a ≠ 0, a · 1

a = 1.

We’ll formally state the inverse properties here.

Inverse Property

of Addition

For any real number a,
−a is the additive inverse of a
A number and its opposite add to zero.

a + (−a) = 0

of Multiplication

For any real number a,

a ≠ 0, a · 1

a = 1.

1
a is the multiplicative inverse of a.
A number and its reciprocal multiply to one.

The Identity Property of addition says that when we add 0 to any number, the result is that same number. What happens
when we multiply a number by 0? Multiplying by 0 makes the product equal zero.

What about division involving zero? What is 0 ÷ 3 ? Think about a real example: If there are no cookies in the cookie jar
and 3 people are to share them, how many cookies does each person get? There are no cookies to share, so each person
gets 0 cookies. So, 0 ÷ 3 = 0.

We can check division with the related multiplication fact. So we know 0 ÷ 3 = 0 because 0 · 3 = 0.

Now think about dividing by zero. What is the result of dividing 4 by 0 ? Think about the related multiplication fact:

Is there a number that multiplied by 0 gives 4 ? Since any real number multiplied by 0 gives 0, there is no real number
that can be multiplied by 0 to obtain 4. We conclude that there is no answer to 4 ÷ 0 and so we say that division by 0 is
undefined.

We summarize the properties of zero here.

Properties of Zero

Multiplication by Zero: For any real number a,

a · 0 = 0

0 · a = 0

The product of any number and 0 is 0.

Division by Zero: For any real number a, a ≠ 0

Zero divided by any real number, except itself, is zero.

Division by zero is undefined.

We will now practice using the properties of identities, inverses, and zero to simplify expressions.

EXAMPLE 1.47

Simplify: −84n + (−73n) + 84n.

Solution

Notice that the first and third terms are
opposites; use the Commutative Property of
addition to re-order the terms.
Add left to right.
Add.

−84n + (−73n) + 84n

−84n + 84n + (−73n)

TRY IT : : 1.93

Simplify: −27a + (−48a) + 27a.

TRY IT : : 1.94

Simplify: 39x + (−92x) + (−39x).

Now we will see how recognizing reciprocals is helpful. Before multiplying left to right, look for reciprocals—their product
is 1.

by 0.

Simplify Expressions Using the Distributive Property

Suppose that three friends are going to the movies. They each need $9.25—that’s 9 dollars and 1 quarter—to pay for their
tickets. How much money do they need all together?

You can think about the dollars separately from the quarters. They need 3 times $9 so $27 and 3 times 1 quarter, so 75
cents. In total, they need $27.75. If you think about doing the math in this way, you are using the Distributive Property.

Distributive Property

If a, b, and c are real numbers, then

a(b + c) = ab + ac
(b + c)a = ba + ca
a(b − c) = ab − ac
(b − c)a = ba − ca

In algebra, we use the Distributive Property to remove parentheses as we simplify expressions.

EXAMPLE 1.50

Simplify: 3(x + 4).

Solution

Distribute.
Multiply.

3(x + 4)
3 · x + 3 · 4

TRY IT : : 1.99

Simplify: 4(x + 2).

TRY IT : : 1.100

Simplify: 6(x + 7).

Some students find it helpful to draw in arrows to remind them how to use the Distributive Property. Then the first step
in Example 1.50 would look like this:

There will be times when we’ll need to use the Distributive Property as part of the order of operations. Start by looking at
the parentheses. If the expression inside the parentheses cannot be simplified, the next step would be multiply using the
Distributive Property, which removes the parentheses. The next two examples will illustrate this.

EXAMPLE 1.55

Simplify: 8 − 2(x + 3)

We follow the order of operations. Multiplication comes before subtraction, so we will distribute the 2 first and then
subtract.

Introduction

Imagine being a pilot, but not just any pilot—a drone pilot. Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles, are devices that can be
flown remotely. They contain sensors that can relay information to a command center where the pilot is located. Larger
drones can also carry cargo. In the near future, several companies hope to use drones to deliver materials and piloting a
drone will become an important career. Law enforcement and the military are using drones rather than send personnel
into dangerous situations. Building and piloting a drone requires the ability to program a set of actions, including taking
off, turning, and landing. This, in turn, requires the use of linear equations. In this chapter, you will explore linear
equations, develop a strategy for solving them, and relate them to real-world situations.

Solve Linear Equations Using a General Strategy

Solving an equation is like discovering the answer to a puzzle. The purpose in solving an equation is to find the value or
values of the variable that makes it a true statement. Any value of the variable that makes the equation true is called a
solution to the equation. It is the answer to the puzzle!

Solution of an Equation

A solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.

To determine whether a number is a solution to an equation, we substitute the value for the variable in the equation. If
the resulting equation is a true statement, then the number is a solution of the equation.

HOW TO : : DETERMINE WHETHER A NUMBER IS A SOLUTION TO AN EQUATION.

Step 1.

Substitute the number for the variable in the equation.

Step 2.

Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.

Step 3.

Determine whether the resulting equation is true.

◦

◦

If it is true, the number is a solution.

If it is not true, the number is not a solution.

EXAMPLE 2.1

Determine whether the values are solutions to the equation: 5y + 3 = 10y − 4.

ⓐ y = 3

the solution for the variable.

There are many types of equations that we will learn to solve. In this section we will focus on a linear equation.

Linear Equation

A linear equation is an equation in one variable that can be written, where a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0, as:

To solve a linear equation it is a good idea to have an overall strategy that can be used to solve any linear equation. In
the next example, we will give the steps of a general strategy for solving any linear equation. Simplifying each side of the
equation as much as possible first makes the rest of the steps easier.

HOW TO : : SOLVE LINEAR EQUATIONS USING A GENERAL STRATEGY.

Step 1.

Step 2.

Step 3.

Step 4.

Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.
Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses.
Combine like terms.

Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.
Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.

Collect all the constant terms on the other side of the equation.
Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.

Make the coefficient of the variable term equal to 1.
Use the Multiplication or Division Property of Equality.
State the solution to the equation.

Step 5.

Check the solution.
Substitute the solution into the original equation to make sure the result is a true statement.

EXAMPLE 2.3

Solve: 2
3

(3m − 6) = 5 − m.

Solution

We can solve equations by getting all the variable terms to either side of the equal sign. By collecting the variable terms on
the side where the coefficient of the variable is larger, we avoid working with some negatives. This will be a good strategy
when we solve inequalities later in this chapter. It also helps us prevent errors with negatives.

Classify Equations

Whether or not an equation is true depends on the value of the variable. The equation 7x + 8 = −13 is true when we
replace the variable, x, with the value −3, but not true when we replace x with any other value. An equation like this is
called a conditional equation. All the equations we have solved so far are conditional equations.

Conditional Equation

An equation that is true for one or more values of the variable and false for all other values of the variable is a

Now let’s consider the equation 7y + 14 = 7⎛
Let’s see what happens when we solve for y.

⎝y + 2⎞

⎠. Do you recognize that the left side and the right side are equivalent?

Solve:

⎠

is true for any value of y. We say the solution to the equation is all of

Identity

An equation that is true for any value of the variable is called an identity.

The solution of an identity is all real numbers.

What happens when we solve the equation −8z = −8z + 9 ?

Solve:

Add 8z to both sides to leave the constant alone on the right.

Simplify—the z’s are eliminated.

But 0 ≠ 9.

Solving the equation −8z = −8z + 9 led to the false statement 0 = 9. The equation −8z = −8z + 9 will not be true for
any value of z. It has no solution. An equation that has no solution, or that is false for all values of the variable, is called a
contradiction.

Contradiction

An equation that is false for all values of the variable is called a contradiction.

A contradiction has no solution.

The next few examples will ask us to classify an equation as conditional, an identity, or as a contradiction.

EXAMPLE 2.6

Classify the equation as a conditional equation, an identity, or a contradiction and then state the solution:
6(2n − 1) + 3 = 2n − 8 + 5(2n + 1).

Solve Equations with Fraction or Decimal Coefficients

We could use the General Strategy to solve the next example. This method would work fine, but many students do not
feel very confident when they see all those fractions. So, we are going to show an alternate method to solve equations
with fractions. This alternate method eliminates the fractions.

We will apply the Multiplication Property of Equality and multiply both sides of an equation by the least common
denominator (LCD) of all the fractions in the equation. The result of this operation will be a new equation, equivalent to
the first, but without fractions. This process is called clearing the equation of fractions.

To clear an equation of decimals, we think of all the decimals in their fraction form and then find the LCD of those
denominators.

Some equations have decimals in them. This kind of equation may occur when we solve problems dealing with money
or percentages. But decimals can also be expressed as fractions. For example, 0.7 = 7
10

and 0.29 = 29
100

. So, with an

equation with decimals, we can use the same method we used to clear fractions—multiply both sides of the equation by
the least common denominator.

The next example uses an equation that is typical of the ones we will see in the money applications in a later section.
Notice that we will clear all decimals by multiplying by the LCD of their fraction form.

EXAMPLE 2.13

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

2.2 Use a Problem Solving Strategy

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Use a problem solving strategy for word problems
Solve number word problems
Solve percent applications
Solve simple interest applications

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Translate “six less than twice x” into an algebraic expression.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.8.

2. Convert 4.5% to a decimal.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.40.

3. Convert 0.6 to a percent.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.40.

Have you ever had any negative experiences in the past with word problems? When we feel we have no control, and
continue repeating negative thoughts, we set up barriers to success. Realize that your negative experiences with word
problems are in your past. To move forward you need to calm your fears and change your negative feelings.

Start with a fresh slate and begin to think positive thoughts. Repeating some of the following statements may be helpful
to turn your thoughts positive. Thinking positive thoughts is a first step towards success.

I think I can! I think I can!

While word problems were hard in the past, I think I can try them now.

I am better prepared now—I think I will begin to understand word problems.

I am able to solve equations because I practiced many problems and I got help when I needed it—I can try that
with word problems.

It may take time, but I can begin to solve word problems.

You are now well prepared and you are ready to succeed. If you take control and believe you can be successful, you will
be able to master word problems.

Use a Problem Solving Strategy for Word Problems

Now that we can solve equations, we are ready to apply our new skills to word problems. We will develop a strategy we
can use to solve any word problem successfully.

EXAMPLE 2.14

Solve Number Word Problems

We will now apply the problem solving strategy to “number word problems.” Number word problems give some clues
about one or more numbers and we use these clues to write an equation. Number word problems provide good practice
for using the Problem Solving Strategy.

EXAMPLE 2.15

The sum of seven times a number and eight is thirty-six. Find the number.

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

Some number word problems ask us to find two or more numbers. It may be tempting to name them all with different
variables, but so far, we have only solved equations with one variable. In order to avoid using more than one variable,
we will define the numbers in terms of the same variable. Be sure to read the problem carefully to discover how all the
numbers relate to each other.

EXAMPLE 2.16

The sum of two numbers is negative fifteen. One number is nine less than the other. Find the numbers.

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.

Step 2. Identify what you are looking for.

two numbers

Some number problems involve consecutive integers. Consecutive integers are integers that immediately follow each
other. Examples of consecutive integers are:

1,
−10,
150,

2,
−9,
151,

3,
−8,
152,

4
−7
153

Notice that each number is one more than the number preceding it. Therefore, if we define the first integer as n, the next
consecutive integer is n + 1. The one after that is one more than n + 1, so it is n + 1 + 1, which is n + 2.

n

n + 1

n + 2

1st integer
2nd consecutive integer
3rd consecutive integer

etc.

We will use this notation to represent consecutive integers in the next example.

EXAMPLE 2.17

Find three consecutive integers whose sum is −54.

−17, −18, and −19.

TRY IT : : 2.33

Find three consecutive integers whose sum is −96.

TRY IT : : 2.34

Find three consecutive integers whose sum is −36.

Now that we have worked with consecutive integers, we will expand our work to include consecutive even integers and
consecutive odd integers. Consecutive even integers are even integers that immediately follow one another. Examples
of consecutive even integers are:

24, 26, 28
−12, −10, −8

Notice each integer is two more than the number preceding it. If we call the first one n, then the next one is n + 2. The
one after that would be n + 2 + 2 or n + 4.

n

n + 2

n + 4

1st even integer
2nd consecutive even integer
3rd consecutive even integer

etc.

Consecutive odd integers are odd integers that immediately follow one another. Consider the consecutive odd integers
63, 65, and 67.

63, 65, 67

etc.

Does it seem strange to have to add two (an even number) to get the next odd number? Do we get an odd number or an
even number when we add 2 to 3? to 11? to 47?

Whether the problem asks for consecutive even numbers or odd numbers, you do not have to do anything different. The
pattern is still the same—to get to the next odd or the next even integer, add two.

Step 7. Answer the question.

TRY IT : : 2.37

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

How much does the husband earn?

Let h = the amount the husband earns.

2h − 16,000 = the amount the wife earns
Together the husband and wife earn $110,000.

h + 2h − 16,000 = 110,000
h + 2h − 16,000 = 110,000
3h − 16,000 = 110,000
3h = 126,000
h = 42,000

$42,000 amount husband earns

2h − 16,000 amount wife earns
2(42,000) − 16,000
84,000 − 16,000
68,000

The husband earns $42,000 a year.

Solve Percent Applications

There are several methods to solve percent equations. In algebra, it is easiest if we just translate English sentences into
algebraic equations and then solve the equations. Be sure to change the given percent to a decimal before you use it in
the equation.

EXAMPLE 2.20

Translate and solve:

ⓐ What number is 45% of 84?
ⓑ 8.5% of what amount is $4.76?
ⓒ 168 is what percent of 112?

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

Solution

ⓐ

Translate into algebra. Let n = the number.

Multiply.

ⓑ

37.8 is 45% of 84.

Translate. Let n = the amount.

Multiply.

Divide both sides by 0.085 and simplify.

8.5% of $56 is $4.76

ⓒ

We are asked to find percent, so we must
have our result in percent form.

Translate into algebra. Let p = the percent.

Multiply.

Divide both sides by 112 and simplify.

Convert to percent.

168 is 150% of 112.

Now that we have a problem solving strategy to refer to, and have practiced solving basic percent equations, we are ready
to solve percent applications. Be sure to ask yourself if your final answer makes sense—since many of the applications we
will solve involve everyday situations, you can rely on your own experience.

It is often important in many fields—business, sciences, pop culture—to talk about how much an amount has increased
or decreased over a certain period of time. This increase or decrease is generally expressed as a percent and called the
percent change.

To find the percent change, first we find the amount of change, by finding the difference of the new amount and the
original amount. Then we find what percent the amount of change is of the original amount.

HOW TO : : FIND PERCENT CHANGE.

Step 1.

Step 2.

Find the amount of change.
change = new amount − original amount

Find what percent the amount of change is of the original amount.
change is what percent of the original amount?

Change is what percent of the original amount?

Find the percent.

Let p = the percent.

Applications of discount and mark-up are very common in retail settings.

When you buy an item on sale, the original price has been discounted by some dollar amount. The discount rate, usually
given as a percent, is used to determine the amount of the discount. To determine the amount of discount, we multiply
the discount rate by the original price.

The price a retailer pays for an item is called the original cost. The retailer then adds a mark-up to the original cost to
get the list price, the price he sells the item for. The mark-up is usually calculated as a percent of the original cost. To
determine the amount of mark-up, multiply the mark-up rate by the original cost.

Discount

amount of discount = discount rate · original price
sale price = original amount – discount price

The sale price should always be less than the original price.

Mark-up

amount of mark-up = mark-up rate · original price
list price = original cost + mark-up

The list price should always be more than the original cost.

Solve Simple Interest Applications

Interest is a part of our daily lives. From the interest earned on our savings to the interest we pay on a car loan or credit
card debt, we all have some experience with interest in our lives.

The amount of money you initially deposit into a bank is called the principal, P, and the bank pays you interest, I. When
you take out a loan, you pay interest on the amount you borrow, also called the principal.

In either case, the interest is computed as a certain percent of the principal, called the rate of interest, r. The rate of
interest is usually expressed as a percent per year, and is calculated by using the decimal equivalent of the percent. The
variable t, (for time) represents the number of years the money is saved or borrowed.

Interest is calculated as simple interest or compound interest. Here we will use simple interest.

Simple Interest

If an amount of money, P, called the principal, is invested or borrowed for a period of t years at an annual interest rate
r, the amount of interest, I, earned or paid is

I = Prt

where

I = interest
P = principal
r = rate
t = time

Interest earned or paid according to this formula is called simple interest.

The formula we use to calculate interest is I = Prt. To use the formula we substitute in the values for variables that are
given, and then solve for the unknown variable. It may be helpful to organize the information in a chart.

EXAMPLE 2.25

Areli invested a principal of $950 in her bank account that earned simple interest at an interest rate of 3%. How much
interest did she earn in five years?

Solution

I = ?
P = $950
r = 3%
t = 5 years

Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable

We have all probably worked with some geometric formulas in our study of mathematics. Formulas are used in so many
fields, it is important to recognize formulas and be able to manipulate them easily.

It is often helpful to solve a formula for a specific variable. If you need to put a formula in a spreadsheet, it is not unusual
to have to solve it for a specific variable first. We isolate that variable on one side of the equals sign with a coefficient of
one and all other variables and constants are on the other side of the equal sign.
Geometric formulas often need to be solved for another variable, too. The formula V = 1

πr 2 h is used to find the volume

of a right circular cone when given the radius of the base and height. In the next example, we will solve this formula for

πr 2 h for h.

Solution

In the next example, we will work with a right triangle. To solve for the measure of each angle, we need to use two
triangle properties. In any triangle, the sum of the measures of the angles is 180°. We can write this as a formula:
m ∠ A + m ∠ B + m ∠ C = 180. Also, since the triangle is a right triangle, we remember that a right triangle has one
90° angle.

Here, we will have to define one angle in terms of another. We will wait to draw the figure until we write expressions for
all the angles we are looking for.

Solve Coin Word Problems

Using algebra to find the number of nickels and pennies in a piggy bank may seem silly. You may wonder why we just
don’t open the bank and count them. But this type of problem introduces us to some techniques that will be useful as we
move forward in our study of mathematics.

If we have a pile of dimes, how would we determine its value? If we count the number of dimes, we’ll know how many
we have—the number of dimes. But this does not tell us the value of all the dimes. Say we counted 23 dimes, how much
are they worth? Each dime is worth $0.10—that is the value of one dime. To find the total value of the pile of 23 dimes,
multiply 23 by $0.10 to get $2.30.

The number of dimes times the value of each dime equals the total value of the dimes.

number · value = total value
23 · $0.10 = $2.30

This method leads to the following model.

Total Value of Coins

For the same type of coin, the total value of a number of coins is found by using the model

number · value = total value

• number is the number of coins

•

•

value is the value of each coin

total value is the total value of all the coins

If we had several types of coins, we could continue this process for each type of coin, and then we would know the total
value of each type of coin. To get the total value of all the coins, add the total value of each type of coin.

Solve Ticket and Stamp Word Problems

Problems involving tickets or stamps are very much like coin problems. Each type of ticket and stamp has a value, just like
each type of coin does. So to solve these problems, we will follow the same steps we used to solve coin problems.

EXAMPLE 2.40

Danny paid $15.75 for stamps. The number of 49-cent stamps was five less than three times the number of 35-cent
stamps. How many 49-cent stamps and how many 35-cent stamps did Danny buy?

Solution

Step 1. Determine the types of stamps involved.

49-cent stamps and 35-cent stamps

Step 2. Identify we are looking for.

Step 3. Write variable expressions to represent the
number of each type of stamp.

“The number of 49-cent stamps was five less
than three times the number of 35-cent
stamps.”

the number of 49-cent stamps and the
number of 35-cent stamps

Let x = number of 35-cent stamps.

3x − 5 = number of 49-cent stamps

152

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

Step 4. Write the equation from the total values.

Step 5. Solve the equation.

How many 49-cent stamps?

Step 6. Check.
10(0.35) + 25(0.49) =? 15.75
3.50 + 12.25 =? 15.75

15.75 = 15.75✓

Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.

Danny bought ten 35-cent stamps and
twenty-five 49-cent stamps.

TRY IT : : 2.79

Eric paid $19.88 for stamps. The number of 49-cent stamps was eight more than twice the number of 35-cent

TRY IT : : 2.80

Kailee paid $14.74 for stamps. The number of 49-cent stamps was four less than three times the number of 20-cent
stamps. How many 49-cent stamps and how many 20-cent stamps did Kailee buy?

In most of our examples so far, we have been told that one quantity is four more than twice the other, or something
similar. In our next example, we have to relate the quantities in a different way.

Suppose Aniket sold a total of 100 tickets. Each ticket was either an adult ticket or a child ticket. If he sold 20 child tickets,
how many adult tickets did he sell?

Did you say “80”? How did you figure that out? Did you subtract 20 from 100?

If he sold 45 child tickets, how many adult tickets did he sell?

Did you say “55”? How did you find it? By subtracting 45 from 100?

Now, suppose Aniket sold x child tickets. Then how many adult tickets did he sell? To find out, we would follow the same
logic we used above. In each case, we subtracted the number of child tickets from 100 to get the number of adult tickets.
We now do the same with x.

We have summarized this in the table.

We will apply this technique in the next example.

EXAMPLE 2.41

A whale-watching ship had 40 paying passengers on board. The total revenue collected from tickets was $1,196. Full-fare
passengers paid $32 each and reduced-fare passengers paid $26 each. How many full-fare passengers and how many
reduced-fare passengers were on the ship?

Solution

Step 1. Determine the types of tickets involved.

full-fare tickets and reduced-fare tickets

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

the number of full-fare tickets and reduced-fare tickets

Step 3. Name. Represent the number of each
type of ticket using variables.

Let f = the number of full-fare tickets.
40 − f = the number of reduced-fare tickets

We know the total number of tickets sold was
40. This means the number of reduced-fare
tickets is 40 less the number of full-fare tickets.
Multiply the number times the value to get the
total value of each type of ticket.

Step 4. Translate. Write the equation by
adding the total values of each type of ticket.

Step 5. Solve the equation.

How many reduced-fare?

Step 6. Check the answer.
There were 26 full-fare tickets at $32 each and
14 reduced-fare tickets at $26 each. Is the total
value $116?
26 · 32 = 832

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

quantities, such as raisins and nuts, to create a mixture, such as trail mix. In our tables we will have a row for each item to
be mixed as well as one for the final mixture.

EXAMPLE 2.42

Henning is mixing raisins and nuts to make 25 pounds of trail mix. Raisins cost $4.50 a pound and nuts cost $8 a pound. If
Henning wants his cost for the trail mix to be $6.60 a pound, how many pounds of raisins and how many pounds of nuts
should he use?

Solution

Step 1. Determine what is being mixed.

The 25 pounds of trail mix will come from mixing raisins
and nuts.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

the number of pounds of raisins and nuts

Step 3. Represent the number of each type
of ticket using variables.

x = number of pounds of raisins.

Let
25 − x = number of pounds of nuts

As before, we fill in a chart to organize our
information.
We enter the price per pound for each item.
We multiply the number times the value to
get the total value.

Notice that the last column in the table gives
the information for the total amount of the
mixture.

Step 4. Translate into an equation.

Step 5. Solve the equation.

Find the number of pounds of nuts.

Step 6. Check.

4.5(10) + 8(15) =? 25(6.60)

Solve Uniform Motion Applications

When you are driving down the interstate using your cruise control, the speed of your car stays the same—it is uniform.
We call a problem in which the speed of an object is constant a uniform motion application. We will use the distance, rate,
and time formula, D = rt,
to compare two scenarios, such as two vehicles travelling at different rates or in opposite
directions.

Our problem solving strategies will still apply here, but we will add to the first step. The first step will include drawing a
diagram that shows what is happening in the example. Drawing the diagram helps us understand what is happening so
that we will write an appropriate equation. Then we will make a table to organize the information, like we did for the coin,
ticket, and stamp applications.

The steps are listed here for easy reference:

HOW TO : : SOLVE A UNIFORM MOTION APPLICATION.

Step 1.

Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.

◦ Draw a diagram to illustrate what is happening.

◦ Create a table to organize the information.

▪ Label the columns rate, time, distance.

▪ List the two scenarios.

▪ Write in the information you know.

Step 2.

Identify what you are looking for.

Step 3.

Name what you are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

◦ Complete the chart.

◦ Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.

◦ Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.

Step 4.

Translate into an equation.

◦ Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.

◦ Then, translate the sentence into an equation.

Step 5.

Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.

Step 6.

Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.

Step 7.

Answer the question with a complete sentence.

EXAMPLE 2.43

Wayne and Dennis like to ride the bike path from Riverside Park to the beach. Dennis’s speed is seven miles per hour
faster than Wayne’s speed, so it takes Wayne two hours to ride to the beach while it takes Dennis 1.5 hours for the ride.
Find the speed of both bikers.

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.

• Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening. Shown below is a sketch of what is happening in the example.

156

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

• Create a table to organize the information.

◦ Label the columns “Rate,” “Time,” and “Distance.”
◦ List the two scenarios.
◦ Write in the information you know.

Step 2. Identify what you are looking for.

You are asked to find the speed of both bikers.

Notice that the distance formula uses the word “rate,” but it is more common to use “speed”

when we talk about vehicles in everyday English.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

• Complete the chart
• Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.

We are looking for the speed of the bikers. Let’s let r represent Wayne’s speed. Since Dennis’ speed is 7 mph
faster, we represent that as r + 7
r + 7 = Dennis’ speed
r = Wayne’s speed
Fill in the speeds into the chart.

• Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.

Step 4. Translate into an equation.

• Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
• Then, translate the sentence into an equation.

The equation to model this situation will come from the relation between the distances. Look at the diagram we
drew above. How is the distance travelled by Dennis related to the distance travelled by Wayne?
Since both bikers leave from Riverside and travel to the beach, they travel the same distance. So we write:

In Example 2.43, we had two bikers traveling the same distance. In the next example, two people drive toward each other
until they meet.

EXAMPLE 2.44

Carina is driving from her home in Anaheim to Berkeley on the same day her brother is driving from Berkeley to Anaheim,
so they decide to meet for lunch along the way in Buttonwillow. The distance from Anaheim to Berkeley is 395 miles. It
takes Carina three hours to get to Buttonwillow, while her brother drives four hours to get there. Carina’s average speed
is 15 miles per hour faster than her brother’s average speed. Find Carina’s and her brother’s average speeds.

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.

• Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening. Below shows a sketch of what is happening in the example.

• Create a table to organize the information.

◦ Label the columns rate, time, distance.
◦ List the two scenarios.
◦ Write in the information you know.

158

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

We are asked to find the average speeds of Carina and her brother.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

• Complete the chart.
• Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.

We are looking for their average speeds. Let’s let r represent the average speed of Carina. Since the brother’s
speed is 15 mph faster, we represent that as r + 15.
Fill in the speeds into the chart.

• Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.

Step 4. Translate into an equation.

• Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
• Then, translate the sentence into an equation.

Again, we need to identify a relationship between the distances in order to write an equation. Look at the diagram
we created above and notice the relationship between the distance Carina traveled and the distance her brother
traveled.
The distance Carina traveled plus the distance her brother travel must add up to 410 miles. So we write:

Step 5. Solve the equation using algebra techniques.

Now solve this equation.

Carina’s speed is r + 15.

So Carina’s brother's speed was 50 mph.

Her brother’s speed was 65 mph.

Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.

Carina drove 65 mph(3 hours) =

195 miles
Her brother drove 50 mph(4 hours) = 200 miles

—————
395 miles ✓

Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.

Carina drove 65 mph and her brother 50 mph.

As you read the next example, think about the relationship of the distances traveled. Which of the previous two examples
is more similar to this situation?

EXAMPLE 2.45

west. The truck traveling west travels at 70 mph and the truck traveling east has an average speed of 60 mph. How long
will they travel before they are 325 miles apart?

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem. Make all the words and ideas are understood.

• Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening.

• Create a table to organize the information.

◦ Label the columns rate, time, distance.
◦ List the two scenarios.
◦ Write in the information you know.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

We are asked to find the amount of time the trucks will travel until they are 325 miles apart.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

• Complete the chart.
• Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.

We are looking for the time travelled. Both trucks will travel the same amount of time.
Let’s call the time t. Since their speeds are different, they will travel different distances.

• Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.

Step 4. Translate into an equation.

160

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

• Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
• Then, translate the sentence into an equation.

We need to find a relation between the distances in order to write an equation. Looking at the diagram, what is
the relationship between the distances each of the trucks will travel?
The distance travelled by the truck going west plus the distance travelled by the truck going east must add up to
325 miles. So we write:

Step 5. Solve the equation using algebra techniques.

Now solve this equation

70t + 60t = 325
130t = 325
t = 2.5

So it will take the trucks 2.5 hours to be 325 miles apart.

Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.

Truck going West 70 mph(2.5 hours) = 175 miles
Truck going East 60 mph(2.5hours) = 150 miles

—————
325 miles ✓

It is important to make sure that the units match when we use the distance rate and time formula. For instance, if the rate
is in miles per hour, then the time must be in hours.

EXAMPLE 2.46

Solution

First, we draw a diagram that represents the situation to help us see what is happening.

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

161

We are asked to find her speed walking and riding her bike. Let’s call her walking speed r. Since her biking speed is three
miles per hour faster, we will call that speed r + 3. We write the speeds in the chart.

The speed is in miles per hour, so we need to express the times in hours, too, in order for the units to be the same.
Remember, 1 hour is 60 minutes. So:

30 minutes is 30
60
15 minutes is 15
60

or 1

We write the times in the chart.

minutes to drive the boat back downstream to the dock. The boat’s speed going downstream is four miles per

In the distance, rate and time formula, time represents the actual amount of elapsed time (in hours, minutes, etc.). If a
problem gives us starting and ending times as clock times, we must find the elapsed time in order to use the formula.

EXAMPLE 2.47

Cruz is training to compete in a triathlon. He left his house at 6:00 and ran until 7:30. Then he rode his bike until 9:45. He
covered a total distance of 51 miles. His speed when biking was 1.6 times his speed when running. Find Cruz’s biking and
running speeds.

Solution

A diagram will help us model this trip.

Next, we create a table to organize the information. We know the total distance is 51 miles. We are looking for the rate of
speed for each part of the trip. The rate while biking is 1.6 times the rate of running. If we let r = the rate running, then
the rate biking is 1.6r.

The times here are given as clock times. Cruz started from home at 6:00 a.m. and started biking at 7:30 a.m. So he spent
1.5 hours running. Then he biked from 7:30 a.m until 9:45 a.m. So he spent 2.25 hours biking.

Now, we multiply the rates by the times.

By looking at the diagram, we can see that the sum of the distance running and the distance biking is 255 miles.

Solve linear inequalities
Translate words to an inequality and solve
Solve applications with linear inequalities

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Translate from algebra to English: 15 > x.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.3.

2. Translate to an algebraic expression: 15 is less than x.
If you missed this problem, review Example 1.8.

Graph Inequalities on the Number Line

What number would make the inequality x > 3 true? Are you thinking, “x could be four”? That’s correct, but x could be
6, too, or 37, or even 3.001. Any number greater than three is a solution to the inequality x > 3.

We show all the solutions to the inequality x > 3 on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of three,
to show that all numbers greater than three are solutions. Because the number three itself is not a solution, we put an
open parenthesis at three.

We can also represent inequalities using interval notation. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In
interval notation, we express x > 3 as (3, ∞). The symbol ∞ is read as “infinity.” It is not an actual number.

Figure 2.2 shows both the number line and the interval notation.

Figure 2.2 The inequality x > 3 is graphed on this number line
and written in interval notation.

We use the left parenthesis symbol, (, to show that the endpoint of the inequality is not included. The left bracket symbol,
[, shows that the endpoint is included.

The inequality x ≤ 1 means all numbers less than or equal to one. Here we need to show that one is a solution, too. We
do that by putting a bracket at x = 1. We then shade in all the numbers to the left of one, to show that all numbers less
than one are solutions. See Figure 2.3.

There is no lower end to those numbers. We write x ≤ 1 in interval notation as (−∞, 1]. The symbol −∞ is read as
“negative infinity.” Figure 2.3 shows both the number line and interval notation.

Figure 2.3 The inequality x ≤ 1 is graphed on this number line
and written in interval notation.

inequality is an inequality in one variable that can be written in one of the forms, ax + b < c, ax + b ≤ c,
ax + b > c, or ax + b ≥ c.

Linear Inequality

A linear inequality is an inequality in one variable that can be written in one of the following forms where a, b, and c
are real numbers and a ≠ 0 :

ax + b < c,

ax + b ≤ c,

ax + b > c,

ax + b ≥ c.

When we solved linear equations, we were able to use the properties of equality to add, subtract, multiply, or divide both
sides and still keep the equality. Similar properties hold true for inequalities.

We can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality. For example:

Notice that the inequality sign stayed the same.

This leads us to the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality.

Addition and Subtraction Property of Inequality

For any numbers a, b, and c, if a < b, then

a + c < b + c
a + c > b + c

a − c < b − c
a − c > b − c

We can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality.

What happens to an inequality when we divide or multiply both sides by a constant?

Let’s first multiply and divide both sides by a positive number.

The inequality signs stayed the same.

Does the inequality stay the same when we divide or multiply by a negative number?

Notice that when we filled in the inequality signs, the inequality signs reversed their direction.

When we divide or multiply an inequality by a positive number, the inequality sign stays the same. When we divide or
multiply an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses.

This gives us the Multiplication and Division Property of Inequality.

Multiplication and Division Property of Inequality

For any numbers a, b, and c,

172

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

multiply or divide by a positive

if a < b and c > 0, then ac < bc and a
if a > b and c > 0, then ac > bc and a

c < b
c.
c > b
c.

multiply or divide by a negative

if a < b and c < 0, then ac > bc and a

c > b
c.

if a > b and c < 0, then ac < bc and a

c < b
c.

When we divide or multiply an inequality by a:

• positive number, the inequality stays the same.

• negative number, the inequality reverses.

Sometimes when solving an inequality, as in the next example, the variable ends upon the right. We can rewrite the
inequality in reverse to get the variable to the left.

Think about it as “If Xander is taller than Andy, then Andy is shorter than Xander.”

x > a has the same meaning as a < x

When solving inequalities, it is usually easiest to collect the variables on the side where the coefficient of the variable is
largest. This eliminates negative coefficients and so we don’t have to multiply or divide by a negative—which means we
don’t have to remember to reverse the inequality sign.

8p + 3(p − 12) > 7p − 28

8p + 3p − 36 > 7p − 28

Subtract 7p from both sides to collect the
variables on the left, since 11 > 7.

Just like some equations are identities and some are contradictions, inequalities may be identities or contradictions, too.
We recognize these forms when we are left with only constants as we solve the inequality. If the result is a true statement,
we have an identity. If the result is a false statement, we have a contradiction.

Solve Applications with Linear Inequalities

Many real-life situations require us to solve inequalities. The method we will use to solve applications with linear
inequalities is very much like the one we used when we solved applications with equations.

We will read the problem and make sure all the words are understood. Next, we will identify what we are looking for and
assign a variable to represent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it easy to translate into an inequality.
Then, we will solve the inequality.

Sometimes an application requires the solution to be a whole number, but the algebraic solution to the inequality is not a
whole number. In that case, we must round the algebraic solution to a whole number. The context of the application will
determine whether we round up or down.

EXAMPLE 2.57

Dawn won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom. The tablets she would like to buy cost $254.12
each, including tax and delivery. What is the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy?

Rounding down the price to $250, 15
tablets would cost $3,750, while 16
tablets would be $4,000. So a
maximum of 15 tablets at $254.12
seems reasonable.

the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy

2.6 Solve Compound Inequalities

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

2. Simplify: −(x − 4).

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.54.

Solve Compound Inequalities with “and”

Now that we know how to solve linear inequalities, the next step is to look at compound inequalities. A compound
inequality is made up of two inequalities connected by the word “and” or the word “or.” For example, the following are
compound inequalities.

Compound Inequality

x + 3 > −4 and 4x − 5 ≤ 3
y − 5 ≥ −2
or
2(y + 1) < 0

A compound inequality is made up of two inequalities connected by the word “and” or the word “or.”

To solve a compound inequality means to find all values of the variable that make the compound inequality a true
statement. We solve compound inequalities using the same techniques we used to solve linear inequalities. We solve each
inequality separately and then consider the two solutions.

To solve a compound inequality with the word “and,” we look for all numbers that make both inequalities true. To solve a
compound inequality with the word “or,” we look for all numbers that make either inequality true.

Let’s start with the compound inequalities with “and.” Our solution will be the numbers that are solutions to both
inequalities known as the intersection of the two inequalities. Consider the intersection of two streets—the part where
the streets overlap—belongs to both streets.

To find the solution of the compound inequality, we look at the graphs of each inequality and then find the numbers that
belong to both graphs—where the graphs overlap.

For the compound inequality x > −3 and x ≤ 2, we graph each inequality. We then look for where the graphs
“overlap”. The numbers that are shaded on both graphs, will be shaded on the graph of the solution of the compound
inequality. See Figure 2.5.

188

Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

Figure 2.5

We can see that the numbers between −3 and 2 are shaded on both of the first two graphs. They will then be shaded
on the solution graph.

The number −3 is not shaded on the first graph and so since it is not shaded on both graphs, it is not included on the
solution graph.

The number two is shaded on both the first and second graphs. Therefore, it is be shaded on the solution graph.

This is how we will show our solution in the next examples.

Sometimes we have a compound inequality that can be written more concisely. For example, a < x and x < b can be
written simply as a < x < b and then we call it a double inequality. The two forms are equivalent.

Double Inequality

A double inequality is a compound inequality such as a < x < b. It is equivalent to a < x and x < b.

Other forms:

a < x < b
a ≤ x ≤ b
a > x > b
a ≥ x ≥ b

isolating the variable in the center.

Solve Compound Inequalities with “or”

To solve a compound inequality with “or”, we start out just as we did with the compound inequalities with “and”—we
solve the two inequalities. Then we find all the numbers that make either inequality true.

Just as the United States is the union of all of the 50 states, the solution will be the union of all the numbers that make
either inequality true. To find the solution of the compound inequality, we look at the graphs of each inequality, find the
numbers that belong to either graph and put all those numbers together.

To write the solution in interval notation, we will often use the union symbol, ∪ to show the union of the solutions
shown in the graphs.

Solve Applications with Compound Inequalities

Situations in the real world also involve compound inequalities. We will use the same problem solving strategy that we
used to solve linear equation and inequality applications.

Recall the problem solving strategies are to first read the problem and make sure all the words are understood. Then,
identify what we are looking for and assign a variable to represent it. Next, restate the problem in one sentence to make
it easy to translate into a compound inequality. Last, we will solve the compound inequality.

EXAMPLE 2.67

Due to the drought in California, many communities have tiered water rates. There are different rates for Conservation
Usage, Normal Usage and Excessive Usage. The usage is measured in the number of hundred cubic feet (hcf) the property
owner uses.

During the summer, a property owner will pay $24.72 plus $1.54 per hcf for Normal Usage. The bill for Normal Usage
would be between or equal to $57.06 and $171.02. How many hcf can the owner use if he wants his usage to stay in the
normal range?

Solve Absolute Value Equations

As we prepare to solve absolute value equations, we review our definition of absolute value.

Absolute Value

The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line.

The absolute value of a number n is written as |n| and |n| ≥ 0 for all numbers.

Absolute values are always greater than or equal to zero.

We learned that both a number and its opposite are the same distance from zero on the number line. Since they have the
same distance from zero, they have the same absolute value. For example:

−5 is 5 units away from 0, so |−5| = 5.
5 is 5 units away from 0, so |5| = 5.

Figure 2.6 illustrates this idea.

Figure 2.6 The numbers 5 and −5 are both five
units away from zero.

For the equation |x| = 5, we are looking for all numbers that make this a true statement. We are looking for the numbers
whose distance from zero is 5. We just saw that both 5 and −5 are five units from zero on the number line. They are the
solutions to the equation.

If
then

|x| = 5
x = −5 or x = 5

The solution can be simplified to a single statement by writing x = ±5. This is read, “x is equal to positive or negative 5”.

We can generalize this to the following property for absolute value equations.

Some of our absolute value equations could be of the form |u| = |v| where u and v are algebraic expressions. For
example,

|x − 3| = |2x + 1|.

How would we solve them? If two algebraic expressions are equal in absolute value, then they are either equal to each
other or negatives of each other. The property for absolute value equations says that for any algebraic expression, u, and
a positive real number, a, if |u| = a,

then u = −a or u = a.

This tell us that

This leads us to the following property for equations with two absolute values.

Solve Absolute Value Inequalities with “Less Than”

Let’s look now at what happens when we have an absolute value inequality. Everything we’ve learned about solving
inequalities still holds, but we must consider how the absolute value impacts our work.

Again we will look at our definition of absolute value. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the
number line. For the equation |x| = 5, we saw that both 5 and −5 are five units from zero on the number line. They are
the solutions to the equation.

x = −5

|x| = 5
or

x = 5

What about the inequality |x| ≤ 5 ? Where are the numbers whose distance is less than or equal to 5? We know −5 and
5 are both five units from zero. All the numbers between −5 and 5 are less than five units from zero. See Figure 2.7.

Figure 2.7

In a more general way, we can see that if |u| ≤ a,

then −a ≤ u ≤ a. See Figure 2.8.

This result is summarized here.

if

|u| < a,

then −a < u < a

After solving an inequality, it is often helpful to check some points to see if the solution makes sense. The graph of
the solution divides the number line into three sections. Choose a value in each section and substitute it in the original
inequality to see if it makes the inequality true or not. While this is not a complete check, it often helps verify the solution.

Solve Absolute Value Inequalities with “Greater Than”

What happens for absolute value inequalities that have “greater than”? Again we will look at our definition of absolute
value. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line.

We started with the inequality |x| ≤ 5. We saw that the numbers whose distance is less than or equal to five from zero
on the number line were −5 and 5 and all the numbers between −5 and 5. See Figure 2.9.

Figure 2.9

Now we want to look at the inequality |x| ≥ 5. Where are the numbers whose distance from zero is greater than or equal
to five?

Again both −5 and 5 are five units from zero and so are included in the solution. Numbers whose distance from zero is
greater than five units would be less than −5 and greater than 5 on the number line. See Figure 2.10.

Figure 2.10

In a more general way, we can see that if |u| ≥ a,

then u ≤ −a or u ≤ a. See Figure 2.11.

Solve Applications with Absolute Value

Absolute value inequalities are often used in the manufacturing process. An item must be made with near perfect
specifications. Usually there is a certain tolerance of the difference from the specifications that is allowed. If the difference
from the specifications exceeds the tolerance, the item is rejected.

EXAMPLE 2.77

|actual-ideal| ≤ tolerance

The ideal diameter of a rod needed for a machine is 60 mm. The actual diameter can vary from the ideal diameter by
0.075 mm. What range of diameters will be acceptable to the customer without causing the rod to be rejected?

Introduction

Imagine visiting a faraway city or even outer space from the comfort of your living room. It could be possible using virtual
reality. This technology creates realistic images that make you feel as if you are truly immersed in the scene and even
enable you to interact with them. It is being developed for fun applications, such as video games, but also for architects
to plan buildings, car companies to design prototypes, the military to train, and medical students to learn.

Developing virtual reality devices requires modeling the environment using graphs and mathematical relationships. In
this chapter, you will graph different relationships and learn ways to describe and analyze graphs.

3.1 Graph Linear Equations in Two Variables

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Plot points in a rectangular coordinate system
Graph a linear equation by plotting points
Graph vertical and horizontal lines
Find the x- and y-intercepts
Graph a line using the intercepts

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

3. Solve for y: 8 − 3y = 20.

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.2.

Plot Points on a Rectangular Coordinate System

Just like maps use a grid system to identify locations, a grid system is used in algebra to show a relationship between
two variables in a rectangular coordinate system. The rectangular coordinate system is also called the xy-plane or the
“coordinate plane.”

The rectangular coordinate system is formed by two intersecting number lines, one horizontal and one vertical. The
horizontal number line is called the x-axis. The vertical number line is called the y-axis. These axes divide a plane into four
regions, called quadrants. The quadrants are identified by Roman numerals, beginning on the upper right and proceeding
counterclockwise. See Figure 3.2.

Figure 3.2

In the rectangular coordinate system, every point is represented by an ordered pair. The first number in the ordered pair
is the x-coordinate of the point, and the second number is the y-coordinate of the point. The phrase “ordered pair” means
that the order is important.

Ordered Pair

An ordered pair, (x, y) gives the coordinates of a point in a rectangular coordinate system. The first number is the
x-coordinate. The second number is the y-coordinate.

What is the ordered pair of the point where the axes cross? At that point both coordinates are zero, so its ordered pair is
(0, 0). The point (0, 0) has a special name. It is called the origin.

The Origin

The point (0, 0) is called the origin. It is the point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect.

We use the coordinates to locate a point on the xy-plane. Let’s plot the point (1, 3) as an example. First, locate 1 on the
x-axis and lightly sketch a vertical line through x = 1. Then, locate 3 on the y-axis and sketch a horizontal line through
y = 3. Now, find the point where these two lines meet—that is the point with coordinates (1, 3). See Figure 3.3.

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

227

Figure 3.3

Notice that the vertical line through x = 1 and the horizontal line through y = 3 are not part of the graph. We just used
them to help us locate the point (1, 3).

When one of the coordinate is zero, the point lies on one of the axes. In Figure 3.4 the point (0, 4) is on the y-axis and
the point (−2, 0) is on the x-axis.

Points on the Axes

Figure 3.4

Points with a y-coordinate equal to 0 are on the x-axis, and have coordinates (a, 0).

Points with an x-coordinate equal to 0 are on the y-axis, and have coordinates (0, b).

⎞
⎠.

Solution

The first number of the coordinate pair is the x-coordinate, and the second number is the y-coordinate. To plot each
point, sketch a vertical line through the x-coordinate and a horizontal line through the y-coordinate. Their intersection
is the point.

Up to now, all the equations you have solved were equations with just one variable. In almost every case, when you solved
the equation you got exactly one solution. But equations can have more than one variable. Equations with two variables
may be of the form Ax + By = C. An equation of this form is called a linear equation in two variables.

Linear Equation

An equation of the form Ax + By = C, where A and B are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables.

Here is an example of a linear equation in two variables, x and y.

The equation y = −3x + 5 is also a linear equation. But it does not appear to be in the form Ax + By = C. We can use
the Addition Property of Equality and rewrite it in Ax + By = C form.

Add to both sides.
Simplify.
Use the Commutative Property to put it in
Ax + By = C form.

y = −3x + 5
y + 3x = −3x + 5 + 3x
y + 3x = 5

3x + y = 5

By rewriting y = −3x + 5 as 3x + y = 5, we can easily see that it is a linear equation in two variables because it is
of the form Ax + By = C. When an equation is in the form Ax + By = C, we say it is in standard form of a linear
equation.

Standard Form of Linear Equation

A linear equation is in standard form when it is written Ax + By = C.

Most people prefer to have A, B, and C be integers and A ≥ 0 when writing a linear equation in standard form, although
it is not strictly necessary.

Linear equations have infinitely many solutions. For every number that is substituted for x there is a corresponding y
value. This pair of values is a solution to the linear equation and is represented by the ordered pair (x, y). When we
substitute these values of x and y into the equation, the result is a true statement, because the value on the left side is
equal to the value on the right side.

Solution of a Linear Equation in Two Variables

An ordered pair (x, y) is a solution of the linear equation Ax + By = C,
the x- and y-values of the ordered pair are substituted into the equation.

if the equation is a true statement when

230

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Linear equations have infinitely many solutions. We can plot these solutions in the rectangular coordinate system. The
points will line up perfectly in a straight line. We connect the points with a straight line to get the graph of the equation.
We put arrows on the ends of each side of the line to indicate that the line continues in both directions.

A graph is a visual representation of all the solutions of the equation. It is an example of the saying, “A picture is worth
a thousand words.” The line shows you all the solutions to that equation. Every point on the line is a solution of the
equation. And, every solution of this equation is on this line. This line is called the graph of the equation. Points not on the
line are not solutions!

Graph of a Linear Equation

The graph of a linear equation Ax + By = C is a straight line.

• Every point on the line is a solution of the equation.

• Every solution of this equation is a point on this line.

Graph a Linear Equation by Plotting Points

There are several methods that can be used to graph a linear equation. The first method we will use is called plotting
points, or the Point-Plotting Method. We find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the equation and then plot
them in a rectangular coordinate system. By connecting these points in a line, we have the graph of the linear equation.

TRY IT : : 3.6

Graph the equation by plotting points: y = −2x + 4.

The steps to take when graphing a linear equation by plotting points are summarized here.

HOW TO : : GRAPH A LINEAR EQUATION BY PLOTTING POINTS.

Step 1.

Find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the equation. Organize them in a table.

Step 2.

Step 3.

Plot the points in a rectangular coordinate system. Check that the points line up. If they do not,
carefully check your work.

Draw the line through the three points. Extend the line to fill the grid and put arrows on both
ends of the line.

It is true that it only takes two points to determine a line, but it is a good habit to use three points. If you only plot two
points and one of them is incorrect, you can still draw a line but it will not represent the solutions to the equation. It will
be the wrong line.

If you use three points, and one is incorrect, the points will not line up. This tells you something is wrong and you need to
check your work. Look at the difference between these illustrations.

When an equation includes a fraction as the coefficient of x , we can still substitute any numbers for x. But the arithmetic
is easier if we make “good” choices for the values of x. This way we will avoid fractional answers, which are hard to graph
precisely.

Graph Vertical and Horizontal Lines

Some linear equations have only one variable. They may have just x and no y, or just y without an x. This changes how we
make a table of values to get the points to plot.

Let’s consider the equation x = −3. This equation has only one variable, x. The equation says that x is always equal to

236

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

−3, so its value does not depend on y. No matter what is the value of y, the value of x is always −3.

So to make a table of values, write −3 in for all the x-values. Then choose any values for y. Since x does not depend
on y, you can choose any numbers you like. But to fit the points on our coordinate graph, we’ll use 1, 2, and 3 for the
y-coordinates. See Table 3.2.

equation, y does not depend on x. Fill in 4 for all the y’s in Table 3.3 and then choose any values for x. We’ll use 0, 2, and 4

to the value of x. The equation y = 4 has only one variable. The value of y is constant, it does not depend on the value of
x, so the y-coordinate is always 4.

Notice, in the graph, the equation y = 4x gives a slanted line, while y = 4 gives a horizontal line.

EXAMPLE 3.6

Graph y = −3x and y = −3 in the same rectangular coordinate system.

Find x- and y-intercepts

Every linear equation can be represented by a unique line that shows all the solutions of the equation. We have seen that
when graphing a line by plotting points, you can use any three solutions to graph. This means that two people graphing
the line might use different sets of three points.

At first glance, their two lines might not appear to be the same, since they would have different points labeled. But if all
the work was done correctly, the lines should be exactly the same. One way to recognize that they are indeed the same
line is to look at where the line crosses the x-axis and the y-axis. These points are called the intercepts of a line.

Intercepts of a Line

The points where a line crosses the x-axis and the y-axis are called the intercepts of the line.

Let’s look at the graphs of the lines.

First, notice where each of these lines crosses the x-axis. See Table 3.4.

Now, let’s look at the points where these lines cross the y-axis.

Do you see a pattern?

For each line, the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x-axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the
x-axis has the form (a, 0) and is called the x-intercept of the line. The x-intercept occurs when y is zero.

In each line, the x-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the y-axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the
y-axis has the form (0, b) and is called the y-intercept of the line. The y-intercept occurs when x is zero.

x-intercept and y-intercept of a Line

The x-intercept is the point (a, 0) where the line crosses the x-axis.

To graph a linear equation by plotting points, you need to find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the
equation. You can use the x- and y- intercepts as two of your three points. Find the intercepts, and then find a third point
to ensure accuracy. Make sure the points line up—then draw the line. This method is often the quickest way to graph a
line.

Find the Slope of a Line

When you graph linear equations, you may notice that some lines tilt up as they go from left to right and some lines tilt
down. Some lines are very steep and some lines are flatter.

In mathematics, the measure of the steepness of a line is called the slope of the line.

The concept of slope has many applications in the real world. In construction the pitch of a roof, the slant of the plumbing
pipes, and the steepness of the stairs are all applications of slope. and as you ski or jog down a hill, you definitely
experience slope.

We can assign a numerical value to the slope of a line by finding the ratio of the rise and run. The rise is the amount the
vertical distance changes while the run measures the horizontal change, as shown in this illustration. Slope is a rate of
change. See Figure 3.5.

Figure 3.5

Slope of a Line

The slope of a line is m = rise
run.

The rise measures the vertical change and the run measures the horizontal change.

To find the slope of a line, we locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers. Then we sketch a right triangle
where the two points are vertices and one side is horizontal and one side is vertical.

To find the slope of the line, we measure the distance along the vertical and horizontal sides of the triangle. The vertical
distance is called the rise and the horizontal distance is called the run,

The slope is undefined since division by zero is undefined. So we say that the slope of the vertical line x = 3 is undefined.

All horizontal lines have slope 0. When the y-coordinates are the same, the rise is 0.

The slope of any vertical line is undefined. When the x-coordinates of a line are all the same, the run is 0.

Slope of a Horizontal and Vertical Line

The slope of a horizontal line, y = b,

is 0.

The slope of a vertical line, x = a,

is undefined.

Quick Guide to the Slopes of Lines

Sometimes we’ll need to find the slope of a line between two points when we don’t have a graph to count out the rise and
the run. We could plot the points on grid paper, then count out the rise and the run, but as we’ll see, there is a way to find
the slope without graphing. Before we get to it, we need to introduce some algebraic notation.

We have seen that an ordered pair (x, y) gives the coordinates of a point. But when we work with slopes, we use two
points. How can the same symbol (x, y) be used to represent two different points? Mathematicians use subscripts to
distinguish the points.

258

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

(x1, y1) read “x sub 1, y sub 1”
(x2, y2) read “x sub 2, y sub 2”

We will use (x1, y1) to identify the first point and (x2, y2) to identify the second point.

If we had more than two points, we could use (x3, y3),

(x4, y4), and so on.

Let’s see how the rise and run relate to the coordinates of the two points by taking another look at the slope of the line
between the points (2, 3) and (7, 6), as shown in this graph.

Since we have two points, we will use subscript notation.

On the graph, we counted the rise of 3 and the run of 5.

Notice that the rise of 3 can be found by subtracting the
y-coordinates, 6 and 3, and the run of 5 can be found by

subtracting the x-coordinates 7 and 2.

We rewrite the rise and run by putting in the coordinates.

But 6 is y2, the y-coordinate of the second point and 3 is y1, the y-coordinate

of the first point. So we can rewrite the slope using subscript notation.

Also 7 is the x-coordinate of the second point and 2 is the x-coordinate

of the first point. So again we rewrite the slope using subscript notation.

when we have two points on the line.

Slope of a line between two points

The slope of the line between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:

m =

The slope is:

Graph a Line Given a Point and the Slope

Up to now, in this chapter, we have graphed lines by plotting points, by using intercepts, and by recognizing horizontal
and vertical lines.

We can also graph a line when we know one point and the slope of the line. We will start by plotting the point and then
use the definition of slope to draw the graph of the line.

Graph a Line Using its Slope and Intercept

We have graphed linear equations by plotting points, using intercepts, recognizing horizontal and vertical lines, and using
one point and the slope of the line. Once we see how an equation in slope–intercept form and its graph are related, we’ll
have one more method we can use to graph lines.
See Figure 3.6. Let’s look at the graph of the equation y = 1

is called the “y-form.”

x + 3 is in slope–intercept form. Sometimes the slope–intercept form

Slope Intercept Form of an Equation of a Line

The slope–intercept form of an equation of a line with slope m and y-intercept, (0, b) is y = mx + b.

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Choose the Most Convenient Method to Graph a Line

Now that we have seen several methods we can use to graph lines, how do we know which method to use for a given
equation?

While we could plot points, use the slope–intercept form, or find the intercepts for any equation, if we recognize the most
convenient way to graph a certain type of equation, our work will be easier.

Generally, plotting points is not the most efficient way to graph a line. Let’s look for some patterns to help determine the
most convenient method to graph a line.

Here are five equations we graphed in this chapter, and the method we used to graph each of them.

Equation

#1 x = 2
#2 y = −1
#3 −x + 2y = 6
#4 4x − 3y = 12
#5 y = −x + 4

Method
Vertical line
Horizontal line
Intercepts
Intercepts
Slope–intercept

Equations #1 and #2 each have just one variable. Remember, in equations of this form the value of that one variable is
constant; it does not depend on the value of the other variable. Equations of this form have graphs that are vertical or
horizontal lines.

In equations #3 and #4, both x and y are on the same side of the equation. These two equations are of the form
Ax + By = C. We substituted y = 0 to find the x- intercept and x = 0 to find the y-intercept, and then found a third
point by choosing another value for x or y.

Equation #5 is written in slope–intercept form. After identifying the slope and y-intercept from the equation we used them
to graph the line.

This leads to the following strategy.

Strategy for Choosing the Most Convenient Method to Graph a Line

Consider the form of the equation.

•

If it only has one variable, it is a vertical or horizontal line.

◦

◦

x = a is a vertical line passing through the x-axis at a.

y = b is a horizontal line passing through the y-axis at b.

•

•

If y is isolated on one side of the equation, in the form y = mx + b, graph by using the slope and y-intercept.

◦

Identify the slope and y-intercept and then graph.

If the equation is of the form Ax + By = C,

find the intercepts.

◦ Find the x- and y-intercepts, a third point, and then graph.

Graph and Interpret Applications of Slope–Intercept

Many real-world applications are modeled by linear equations. We will take a look at a few applications here so you can
see how equations written in slope–intercept form relate to real world situations.

Usually, when a linear equation models uses real-world data, different letters are used for the variables, instead of using
only x and y. The variable names remind us of what quantities are being measured.

Also, we often will need to extend the axes in our rectangular coordinate system to bigger positive and negative numbers
to accommodate the data in the application.

and labor needed to produce each item.

C = 0.5m + 60
C = 0.5(250) + 60

Sam’s costs are $185 when he drives 250 miles.

The slope, 0.5, means that the weekly cost, C, increases by $0.50 when the number of miles driven, n, increases by 1.
The C-intercept means that when the number of miles driven is 0, the weekly cost is $60.

Use Slopes to Identify Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

Two lines that have the same slope are called parallel lines. Parallel lines have the same steepness and never intersect.

We say this more formally in terms of the rectangular coordinate system. Two lines that have the same slope and different
y-intercepts are called parallel lines. See Figure 3.7.

, and different y-intercepts.

What about vertical lines? The slope of a vertical line is undefined, so vertical lines don’t fit in the definition above. We say
that vertical lines that have different x-intercepts are parallel, like the lines shown in this graph.

Figure 3.8

Parallel Lines

Parallel lines are lines in the same plane that do not intersect.

• Parallel lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts.

•

If m1 and m2 are the slopes of two parallel lines then m1 = m2.

• Parallel vertical lines have different x-intercepts.

Since parallel lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts, we can now just look at the slope–intercept form of the
equations of lines and decide if the lines are parallel.

ⓐ y = −4 and y = 3 ⓑ x = −2 and x = −5.

Solution

ⓐ y = −4 and y = 3
We recognize right away from the equations that these are horizontal lines, and so we know their slopes are both 0.
Since the horizontal lines cross the y-axis at y = −4 and at y = 3, we know the y-intercepts are (0, −4) and (0, 3).
The lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts and so they are parallel.
ⓑ x = −2 and x = −5
We recognize right away from the equations that these are vertical lines, and so we know their slopes are undefined.
Since the vertical lines cross the x-axis at x = −2 and x = −5, we know the y-intercepts are (−2, 0) and (−5, 0).
The lines are vertical and have different x-intercepts and so they are parallel.

We can do the same thing for perpendicular lines.

We find the slope–intercept form of the equation, and then see if the slopes are opposite reciprocals. If the product of the

the lines are perpendicular.

The physical sciences, social sciences, and the business world are full of situations that can be modeled with linear
equations relating two variables. To create a mathematical model of a linear relation between two variables, we must be
able to find the equation of the line. In this section, we will look at several ways to write the equation of a line. The specific
method we use will be determined by what information we are given.

Find an Equation of the Line Given the Slope and y-Intercept

We can easily determine the slope and intercept of a line if the equation is written in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b.
Now we will do the reverse—we will start with the slope and y-intercept and use them to find the equation of the line.

EXAMPLE 3.24

Find the equation of a line with slope −9 and y-intercept (0, −4).

Solution

Since we are given the slope and y-intercept of the line, we can substitute the needed values into the slope-intercept form,
y = mx + b.

Name the y-intercept.

EXAMPLE 3.25

Find the equation of the line shown in the graph.

Solution

We need to find the slope and y-intercept of the line from the graph so we can substitute the needed values into the
slope-intercept form, y = mx + b.

To find the slope, we choose two points on the graph.

The y-intercept is (0, −4) and the graph passes through (3, −2).

Find an Equation of the Line Given the Slope and a Point

Finding an equation of a line using the slope-intercept form of the equation works well when you are given the slope and
y-intercept or when you read them off a graph. But what happens when you have another point instead of the y-intercept?

We are going to use the slope formula to derive another form of an equation of the line.

Suppose we have a line that has slope m and that contains some specific point (x1, y1) and some other point, which we
will just call (x, y). We can write the slope of this line and then change it to a different form.

Multiply both sides of the equation by x − x1.

Simplify.
Rewrite the equation with the y terms on the left.

m =

y − y1
x − x1
y − y1
⎛
⎝
x − x1
m(x − x1) = y − y1

m(x − x1) =

⎞
⎠(x − x1)

y − y1 = m(x − x1)

This format is called the point-slope form of an equation of a line.

282

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Point-slope Form of an Equation of a Line

The point-slope form of an equation of a line with slope m and containing the point (x1, y1) is:

y − y1 = m(x − x1)

We can use the point-slope form of an equation to find an equation of a line when we know the slope and at least one
point. Then, we will rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form. Most applications of linear equations use the the slope-
intercept form.

Find an Equation of the Line Given Two Points

When real-world data is collected, a linear model can be created from two data points. In the next example we’ll see how
to find an equation of a line when just two points are given.

So far, we have two options for finding an equation of a line: slope-intercept or point-slope. When we start with two points,
it makes more sense to use the point-slope form.

But then we need the slope. Can we find the slope with just two points? Yes. Then, once we have the slope, we can use it
and one of the given points to find the equation.

This tells us it is a vertical line. Both of our points have an x-coordinate of −2. So our equation of the line is x = −2.

You may want to sketch a graph using the two given points. Does your graph agree with our conclusion that this is a

Find an Equation of a Line Parallel to a Given Line

Suppose we need to find an equation of a line that passes through a specific point and is parallel to a given line. We can
use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope. So we will have a point and the slope—just what we need to use the
point-slope equation.

First, let’s look at this graphically.

This graph shows y = 2x − 3. We want to graph a line parallel to this line and passing through the point (−2, 1).

We know that parallel lines have the same slope. So the second line will have the same slope as y = 2x − 3. That slope
is m∥ = 2. We’ll use the notation m∥
to represent the slope of a line parallel to a line with slope m. (Notice that the
subscript || looks like two parallel lines.)

The second line will pass through (−2, 1) and have m = 2.

To graph the line, we start at (−2, 1) and count out the rise and run.

With m = 2 (or m = 2
1

), we count out the rise 2 and the run 1. We draw the line, as shown in the graph.

Do the lines appear parallel? Does the second line pass through (−2, 1) ?

We were asked to graph the line, now let’s see how to do this algebraically.

286

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

We can use either the slope-intercept form or the point-slope form to find an equation of a line. Here we know one point
and can find the slope. So we will use the point-slope form.

Find an Equation of a Line Perpendicular to a Given Line

Now, let’s consider perpendicular lines. Suppose we need to find a line passing through a specific point and which is
perpendicular to a given line. We can use the fact that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. We
will again use the point-slope equation, like we did with parallel lines.

This graph shows y = 2x − 3. Now, we want to graph a line perpendicular to this line and passing through (−2, 1).

We know that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals.
We’ll use the notation m⊥ to represent the slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope m. (Notice that the subscript
⊥ looks like the right angles made by two perpendicular lines.)

We now know the perpendicular line will pass through (−2, 1) with m⊥ = − 1

.

To graph the line, we will start at (−2, 1) and count out the rise −1 and the run 2. Then we draw the line.

Do the lines appear perpendicular? Does the second line pass through (−2, 1) ?

We were asked to graph the line, now, let’s see how to do this algebraically.

We can use either the slope-intercept form or the point-slope form to find an equation of a line. In this example we know
one point, and can find the slope, so we will use the point-slope form.

Solution

Again, since we know one point, the point-slope option seems more promising than the slope-intercept option. We
need the slope to use this form, and we know the new line will be perpendicular to x = 5. This line is vertical, so its
perpendicular will be horizontal. This tells us the m⊥ = 0.

3.4 Graph Linear Inequalities in Two Variables

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Verify solutions to an inequality in two variables.
Recognize the relation between the solutions of an inequality and its graph.
Graph linear inequalities in two variables
Solve applications using linear inequalities in two variables

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Graph x > 2 on a number line.

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.48.

2. Solve: 4x + 3 > 23 .

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.52.

3. Translate: 8 < x > 3 .

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.56.

Verify Solutions to an Inequality in Two Variables

Previously we learned to solve inequalities with only one variable. We will now learn about inequalities containing two
variables. In particular we will look at linear inequalities in two variables which are very similar to linear equations in two
variables.

Linear inequalities in two variables have many applications. If you ran a business, for example, you would want your
revenue to be greater than your costs—so that your business made a profit.

Linear Inequality

A linear inequality is an inequality that can be written in one of the following forms:

Ax + By > C

Ax + By ≥ C

Ax + By < C

Ax + By ≤ C

Where A and B are not both zero.

Recall that an inequality with one variable had many solutions. For example, the solution to the inequality x > 3 is any
number greater than 3. We showed this on the number line by shading in the number line to the right of 3, and putting
an open parenthesis at 3. See Figure 3.10.

Figure 3.10

Similarly, linear inequalities in two variables have many solutions. Any ordered pair (x, y) that makes an inequality true
when we substitute in the values is a solution to a linear inequality.

Solution to a Linear Inequality

An ordered pair (x, y) is a solution to a linear inequality if the inequality is true when we substitute the values of x
and y.

EXAMPLE 3.34

Determine whether each ordered pair is a solution to the inequality y > x + 4 :

ⓐ (0, 0) ⓑ (1, 6) ⓒ (2, 6) ⓓ (−5, −15) ⓔ (−8, 12)

ⓑ

ⓒ

ⓓ

ⓔ

So, (0, 0) is not a solution to y > x + 4.

So, (1, 6) is a solution to y > x + 4.

So, (2, 6) is not a solution to y > x + 4.

So, (−5, −15) is not a solution to y > x + 4.

297

So, (−8, 12) is a solution to y > x + 4.

TRY IT : : 3.67

Determine whether each ordered pair is a solution to the inequality y > x − 3 :

ⓐ (0, 0) ⓑ (4, 9) ⓒ (−2, 1) ⓓ (−5, −3) ⓔ (5, 1)

TRY IT : : 3.68

Determine whether each ordered pair is a solution to the inequality y < x + 1 :

ⓐ (0, 0) ⓑ (8, 6) ⓒ (−2, −1) ⓓ (3, 4) ⓔ (−1, −4)

Recognize the Relation Between the Solutions of an Inequality and its Graph

Now, we will look at how the solutions of an inequality relate to its graph.

Let’s think about the number line in shown previously again. The point x = 3 separated that number line into two parts.
On one side of 3 are all the numbers less than 3. On the other side of 3 all the numbers are greater than 3. See Figure
3.11.

Figure 3.11 The solution to x > 3 is the shaded part of the number
line to the right of x = 3.

Similarly, the line y = x + 4 separates the plane into two regions. On one side of the line are points with y < x + 4. On
the other side of the line are the points with y > x + 4. We call the line y = x + 4 a boundary line.

Boundary Line

The line with equation Ax + By = C is the boundary line that separates the region where Ax + By > C from the
region where Ax + By < C.

For an inequality in one variable, the endpoint is shown with a parenthesis or a bracket depending on whether or not a is
included in the solution:

Similarly, for an inequality in two variables, the boundary line is shown with a solid or dashed line to show whether or not
it the line is included in the solution.

Ax + By < C
Ax + By > C
Boundary line is Ax + By = C
Boundary line is not included in solution.
Boundary line is dashed.

Ax + By ≤ C
Ax + By ≥ C
Boundary line is Ax + By = C
Boundary line is included in solution.
Boundary line is solid.

Now, let’s take a look at what we found in Example 3.34. We’ll start by graphing the line y = x + 4, and then we’ll plot
the five points we tested, as shown in the graph. See Figure 3.12.

298

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Figure 3.12

In Example 3.34 we found that some of the points were solutions to the inequality y > x + 4 and some were not.

Which of the points we plotted are solutions to the inequality y > x + 4 ?

The points (1, 6) and (−8, 12) are solutions to the inequality y > x + 4. Notice that they are both on the same side of
the boundary line y = x + 4.

The two points (0, 0) and (−5, −15) are on the other side of the boundary line y = x + 4, and they are not solutions
to the inequality y > x + 4. For those two points, y < x + 4.

What about the point (2, 6) ? Because 6 = 2 + 4,
to the inequality y > x + 4. So the point (2, 6) is on the boundary line.

the point is a solution to the equation y = x + 4, but not a solution

Let’s take another point above the boundary line and test whether or not it is a solution to the inequality y > x + 4. The
point (0, 10) clearly looks to above the boundary line, doesn’t it? Is it a solution to the inequality?

y > x + 4

?
10 >
10 > 4

0 + 4

So, (0, 10) is a solution to y > x + 4.

Any point you choose above the boundary line is a solution to the inequality y > x + 4. All points above the boundary
line are solutions.

Similarly, all points below the boundary line, the side with (0, 0) and (−5, −15), are not solutions to y > x + 4, as
shown in Figure 3.13.

Figure 3.13

The graph of the inequality y > x + 4 is shown in below.

The line y = x + 4 divides the plane into two regions. The shaded side shows the solutions to the inequality y > x + 4.

The points on the boundary line, those where y = x + 4, are not solutions to the inequality y > x + 4, so the line itself
is not part of the solution. We show that by making the line dashed, not solid.

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

The boundary line shown in this graph is y = 2x − 1. Write the inequality shown by the graph.

Solution

The line y = 2x − 1 is the boundary line. On one side of the line are the points with y > 2x − 1 and on the other side of
the line are the points with y < 2x − 1.

Let’s test the point (0, 0) and see which inequality describes its position relative to the boundary line.

is the solution. The shaded region shows the solution of the

Since the boundary line is graphed with a solid line, the inequality includes the equal sign.

The graph shows the inequality y ≥ 2x − 1.

We could use any point as a test point, provided it is not on the line. Why did we choose (0, 0) ? Because it’s the easiest
to evaluate. You may want to pick a point on the other side of the boundary line and check that y < 2x − 1.

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Solution

The line 2x + 3y = 6 is the boundary line. On one side of the line are the points with 2x + 3y > 6 and on the other side
of the line are the points with 2x + 3y < 6.

Let’s test the point (0, 0) and see which inequality describes its side of the boundary line.

At (0, 0), which inequality is true: 2x + 3y > 6 or 2x + 3y < 6 ?

2x + 3y > 6

(You may want to pick a point on the other side of the boundary line and check that 2x + 3y > 6. )

Since the boundary line is graphed as a dashed line, the inequality does not include an equal sign.

The steps we take to graph a linear inequality are summarized here.

HOW TO : : GRAPH A LINEAR INEQUALITY IN TWO VARIABLES.

Step 1.

Identify and graph the boundary line.

◦

◦

If the inequality is ≤ or ≥ ,

the boundary line is solid.

If the inequality is < or > ,

the boundary line is dashed.

Step 2.

Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?

Step 3.

Shade in one side of the boundary line.

◦

◦

If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.

If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.

EXAMPLE 3.38

Graph the linear inequality x − 2y < 5.

Solution

First, we graph the boundary line x − 2y = 5. The inequality is < so we draw a dashed line.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

305

Then, we test a point. We’ll use (0, 0) again because it is easy to evaluate and it is not on the boundary line.

Is (0, 0) a solution of x − 2y < 5 ?

The point (0, 0) is a solution of x − 2y < 5, so we shade in that side of the boundary line.

All points in the shaded region, but not those on the boundary line, represent the solutions to x − 2y < 5.

TRY IT : : 3.75

Graph the linear inequality: 2x − 3y < 6.

TRY IT : : 3.76

Graph the linear inequality: 2x − y > 3.

What if the boundary line goes through the origin? Then, we won’t be able to use (0, 0) as a test point. No
problem—we’ll just choose some other point that is not on the boundary line.

EXAMPLE 3.39

306

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Graph the linear inequality: y ≤ − 4x.

Solution

First, we graph the boundary line y = −4x. It is in slope–intercept form, with m = −4 and b = 0. The inequality is ≤
so we draw a solid line.

Now we need a test point. We can see that the point (1, 0) is not on the boundary line.

Is (1, 0) a solution of y ≤ −4x ?

The point (1, 0) is not a solution to y ≤ − 4x, so we shade in the opposite side of the boundary line.

All points in the shaded region and on the boundary line represent the solutions to y ≤ − 4x.

EXAMPLE 3.40

Graph the linear inequality: y > 3.

Solution

First, we graph the boundary line y = 3. It is a horizontal line. The inequality is > so we draw a dashed line.

We test the point (0, 0).

So, (0, 0) is not a solution to y > 3.

So we shade the side that does not include (0, 0) as shown in this graph.

Solve Applications using Linear Inequalities in Two Variables

Many fields use linear inequalities to model a problem. While our examples may be about simple situations, they give us
an opportunity to build our skills and to get a feel for how thay might be used.

EXAMPLE 3.41

Hilaria works two part time jobs in order to earn enough money to meet her obligations of at least $240 a week. Her job
in food service pays $10 an hour and her tutoring job on campus pays $15 an hour. How many hours does Hilaria need to
work at each job to earn at least $240?

ⓐ Let x be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let y be the number of hours she works tutoring.
Write an inequality that would model this situation.

308

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

ⓑ Graph the inequality.

ⓒ Find three ordered pairs (x, y) that would be solutions to the inequality. Then, explain what that means for Hilaria.

Solution

ⓐ We let x be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let y be the number of hours she works
tutoring.

She earns $10 per hour at the job in food service and $15 an hour tutoring. At each job, the number of hours multiplied
by the hourly wage will gives the amount earned at that job.

ⓑ To graph the inequality, we put it in slope–intercept form.

10x + 15y ≥ 240

15y ≥ −10x + 240

y ≥ − 2
3

x + 16

ⓒ From the graph, we see that the ordered pairs (15, 10), (0, 16), (24, 0) represent three of infinitely many solutions.
Check the values in the inequality.

For Hilaria, it means that to earn at least $240, she can work 15 hours tutoring and 10 hours at her fast-food job, earn all
her money tutoring for 16 hours, or earn all her money while working 24 hours at the job in food service.

Find the Domain and Range of a Relation

As we go about our daily lives, we have many data items or quantities that are paired to our names. Our social security
number, student ID number, email address, phone number and our birthday are matched to our name. There is a
relationship between our name and each of those items.

When your professor gets her class roster, the names of all the students in the class are listed in one column and then the
student ID number is likely to be in the next column. If we think of the correspondence as a set of ordered pairs, where
the first element is a student name and the second element is that student’s ID number, we call this a relation.

(Student name, Student ID #)

The set of all the names of the students in the class is called the domain of the relation and the set of all student ID
numbers paired with these students is the range of the relation.

There are many similar situations where one variable is paired or matched with another. The set of ordered pairs that
records this matching is a relation.

Relation

A relation is any set of ordered pairs, (x, y). All the x-values in the ordered pairs together make up the domain. All
the y-values in the ordered pairs together make up the range.

EXAMPLE 3.42

For the relation {(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)} :

ⓑ Find the range of the relation.

Solution

ⓐ The domain is the set of all x-values of the relation.

ⓑ The range is the set of all y-values of the relation.

the elements of the range.

A graph is yet another way that a relation can be represented. The set of ordered pairs of all the points plotted is the
relation. The set of all x-coordinates is the domain of the relation and the set of all y-coordinates is the range. Generally
we write the numbers in ascending order for both the domain and range.

ⓐ The ordered pairs of the relation are:

Determine if a Relation is a Function

A special type of relation, called a function, occurs extensively in mathematics. A function is a relation that assigns to each
element in its domain exactly one element in the range. For each ordered pair in the relation, each x-value is matched
with only one y-value.

Function

A function is a relation that assigns to each element in its domain exactly one element in the range.

The birthday example from Example 3.43 helps us understand this definition. Every person has a birthday but no one
has two birthdays. It is okay for two people to share a birthday. It is okay that Danny and Stephen share July 24th as their
birthday and that June and Liz share August 2nd. Since each person has exactly one birthday, the relation in Example 3.43
is a function.

The relation shown by the graph in Example 3.44 includes the ordered pairs (−3, −1) and (−3, 4). Is that okay in a
function? No, as this is like one person having two different birthdays.

EXAMPLE 3.45

Use the set of ordered pairs to (i) determine whether the relation is a function (ii) find the domain of the relation (iii) find
the range of the relation.

(ii) The domain is the set of all x-values in the relation.

In algebra, more often than not, functions will be represented by an equation. It is easiest to see if the equation is a
function when it is solved for y. If each value of x results in only one value of y, then the equation defines a function.

EXAMPLE 3.47

Determine whether each equation is a function.

ⓐ 2x + y = 7 ⓑ y = x2 + 1 ⓒ x + y2 = 3

Solution

ⓐ 2x + y = 7

For each value of x, we multiply it by −2 and then add 7 to get the y-value

For example, if x = 3 :

320

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

We have that when x = 3,
only one value of y the equation defines a function.

then y = 1. It would work similarly for any value of x. Since each value of x, corresponds to

ⓑ y = x2 + 1
For each value of x, we square it and then add 1 to get the y-value.

For example, if x = 2 :

We have that when x = 2,
only one value of y the equation defines a function.

then y = 5. It would work similarly for any value of x. Since each value of x, corresponds to

Let’s substitute x = 2.

This give us two values for y.

Find the Value of a Function

It is very convenient to name a function and most often we name it f, g, h, F, G, or H. In any function, for each x-value from
the domain we get a corresponding y-value in the range. For the function f, we write this range value y as f (x). This is
called function notation and is read f of x or the value of f at x. In this case the parentheses does not indicate multiplication.

Function Notation

For the function y = f (x)

f is the name of the function
x is the domain value
f (x) is the range value y corresponding to the value x

We read f (x) as f of x or the value of f at x.

We call x the independent variable as it can be any value in the domain. We call y the dependent variable as its value
depends on x.

321

Independent and Dependent Variables

For the function y = f (x),

x is the independent variable as it can be any value in the domain
y the dependent variable as its value depends on x

Much as when you first encountered the variable x, function notation may be rather unsettling. It seems strange because
it is new. You will feel more comfortable with the notation as you use it.

Let’s look at the equation y = 4x − 5. To find the value of y when x = 2, we know to substitute x = 2 into the equation
and then simplify.

Let x = 2.

The value of the function at x = 2 is 3.

We do the same thing using function notation, the equation y = 4x − 5 can be written as f (x) = 4x − 5. To find the
value when x = 2, we write:

Let x = 2.

The value of the function at x = 2 is 3.

This process of finding the value of

f (x) for a given value of x is called evaluating the function.

EXAMPLE 3.48

For the function f (x) = 2x2 + 3x − 1, evaluate the function.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.41.

Use the Vertical Line Test

In the last section we learned how to determine if a relation is a function. The relations we looked at were expressed as a
set of ordered pairs, a mapping or an equation. We will now look at how to tell if a graph is that of a function.

An ordered pair (x, y) is a solution of a linear equation, if the equation is a true statement when the x- and y-values of
the ordered pair are substituted into the equation.

The graph of a linear equation is a straight line where every point on the line is a solution of the equation and every
solution of this equation is a point on this line.

In Figure 3.14, we can see that, in graph of the equation y = 2x − 3,
in the accompanying table.

for every x-value there is only one y-value, as shown

Figure 3.14

A relation is a function if every element of the domain has exactly one value in the range. So the relation defined by the
equation y = 2x − 3 is a function.

330

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

If we look at the graph, each vertical dashed line only intersects the line at one point. This makes sense as in a function,
for every x-value there is only one y-value.

If the vertical line hit the graph twice, the x-value would be mapped to two y-values, and so the graph would not represent
a function.

This leads us to the vertical line test. A set of points in a rectangular coordinate system is the graph of a function if every
vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point. If any vertical line intersects the graph in more than one point, the
graph does not represent a function.

Vertical Line Test

A set of points in a rectangular coordinate system is the graph of a function if every vertical line intersects the graph
in at most one point.

If any vertical line intersects the graph in more than one point, the graph does not represent a function.

EXAMPLE 3.51

Determine whether each graph is the graph of a function.

Solution

ⓐ Since any vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, the graph is the graph of a function.

ⓑ One of the vertical lines shown on the graph, intersects it in two points. This graph does not represent a function.

Identify Graphs of Basic Functions

We used the equation y = 2x − 3 and its graph as we developed the vertical line test. We said that the relation defined
by the equation y = 2x − 3 is a function.

We can write this as in function notation as f (x) = 2x − 3. It still means the same thing. The graph of the function is the
graph of all ordered pairs (x, y) where y = f (x). So we can write the ordered pairs as ⎛
⎠. It looks different but
the graph will be the same.

⎝x, f (x)⎞

As we move forward in our study, it is helpful to be familiar with the graphs of several basic functions and be able to
identify them.

Through our earlier work, we are familiar with the graphs of linear equations. The process we used to decide if
y = 2x − 3 is a function would apply to all linear equations. All non-vertical linear equations are functions. Vertical lines
are not functions as the x-value has infinitely many y-values.

We wrote linear equations in several forms, but it will be most helpful for us here to use the slope-intercept form of the
linear equation. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is y = mx + b. In function notation, this linear function
becomes f (x) = mx + b where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.

The domain is the set of all real numbers, and the range is also the set of all real numbers.

Linear Function

We will use the graphing techniques we used earlier, to graph the basic functions.

EXAMPLE 3.52

Graph:

f (x) = −2x − 4.

We recognize this as a linear function.

The next function whose graph we will look at is called the constant function and its equation is of the form f (x) = b,

334

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

where b is any real number. If we replace the f (x) with y, we get y = b. We recognize this as the horizontal line whose
y-intercept is b. The graph of the function f (x) = b,

is also the horizontal line whose y-intercept is b.

Notice that for any real number we put in the function, the function value will be b. This tells us the range has only one
value, b.

Constant Function

EXAMPLE 3.53

Graph:

f (x) = 4.

Solution

We recognize this as a constant function.

The graph will be a horizontal line through (0, 4).

f (x) = 4

Graph:

f (x) = −2.

TRY IT : : 3.106

Graph:

The identity function,

f (x) = x is a special case of the linear function. If we write it in linear function form,

f (x) = 1x + 0, we see the slope is 1 and the y-intercept is 0.

Identity Function

The next function we will look at is not a linear function. So the graph will not be a line. The only method we have to graph
this function is point plotting. Because this is an unfamiliar function, we make sure to choose several positive and negative
values as well as 0 for our x-values.

EXAMPLE 3.54

Graph:

f (x) = x2.

Solution

We choose x-values. We substitute them in and then create a chart as shown.

TRY IT : : 3.107

Graph:

f (x) = x2.

TRY IT : : 3.108

f (x) = −x2

Looking at the result in Example 3.54, we can summarize the features of the square function. We call this graph a
parabola. As we consider the domain, notice any real number can be used as an x-value. The domain is all real numbers.

The range is not all real numbers. Notice the graph consists of values of y never go below zero. This makes sense as the
square of any number cannot be negative. So, the range of the square function is all non-negative real numbers.

336

Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Square Function

The next function we will look at is also not a linear function so the graph will not be a line. Again we will use point plotting,
and make sure to choose several positive and negative values as well as 0 for our x-values.

EXAMPLE 3.55

Graph:

f (x) = x3.

Solution

We choose x-values. We substitute them in and then create a chart.

TRY IT : : 3.110

Looking at the result in Example 3.55, we can summarize the features of the cube function. As we consider the domain,
notice any real number can be used as an x-value. The domain is all real numbers.

The range is all real numbers. This makes sense as the cube of any non-zero number can be positive or negative. So, the
range of the cube function is all real numbers.

Cube Function

The next function we will look at does not square or cube the input values, but rather takes the square root of those
values.

Let’s graph the function f (x) = x and then summarize the features of the function. Remember, we can only take the
square root of non-negative real numbers, so our domain will be the non-negative real numbers.

EXAMPLE 3.56

f (x) = x

Solution

We choose x-values. Since we will be taking the square root, we choose numbers that are perfect squares, to make our
work easier. We substitute them in and then create a chart.

Square Root Function

Our last basic function is the absolute value function,

f (x) = |x|. Keep in mind that the absolute value of a number is its
distance from zero. Since we never measure distance as a negative number, we will never get a negative number in the
range.

We will start by reading the domain and range of a function from its graph.

Remember the domain is the set of all the x-values in the ordered pairs in the function. To find the domain we look at the
graph and find all the values of x that have a corresponding value on the graph. Follow the value x up or down vertically.
If you hit the graph of the function then x is in the domain.

Remember the range is the set of all the y-values in the ordered pairs in the function. To find the range we look at the
graph and find all the values of y that have a corresponding value on the graph. Follow the value y left or right horizontally.
If you hit the graph of the function then y is in the range.

EXAMPLE 3.58

Use the graph of the function to find its domain and range. Write the domain and range in interval notation.

Solution

To find the domain we look at the graph and find all the values of x that correspond to a point on the graph. The domain
is highlighted in red on the graph. The domain is [−3, 3].

Climb into your car. Put on your seatbelt. Choose your destination and then…relax. That’s right. You don’t have to do
anything else because you are in an autonomous car, or one that navigates its way to your destination! No cars are fully
autonomous at the moment and so you theoretically still need to have your hands on the wheel. Self-driving cars may
help ease traffic congestion, prevent accidents, and lower pollution. The technology is thanks to computer programmers
who are developing software to control the navigation of the car. These programmers rely on their understanding of
mathematics, including relationships between equations. In this chapter, you will learn how to solve systems of linear
equations in different ways and use them to analyze real-world situations.

Determine Whether an Ordered Pair is a Solution of a System of Equations

In Solving Linear Equations, we learned how to solve linear equations with one variable. Now we will work with two or
more linear equations grouped together, which is known as a system of linear equations.

System of Linear Equations

When two or more linear equations are grouped together, they form a system of linear equations.

In this section, we will focus our work on systems of two linear equations in two unknowns. We will solve larger systems
of equations later in this chapter.

An example of a system of two linear equations is shown below. We use a brace to show the two equations are grouped
together to form a system of equations.

⎧
2x + y = 7
⎨
x − 2y = 6
⎩

A linear equation in two variables, such as 2x + y = 7, has an infinite number of solutions. Its graph is a line. Remember,
every point on the line is a solution to the equation and every solution to the equation is a point on the line.

To solve a system of two linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions to both equations.
In other words, we are looking for the ordered pairs (x, y) that make both equations true. These are called the solutions
of a system of equations.

Solutions of a System of Equations

The solutions of a system of equations are the values of the variables that make all the equations true. A solution of
a system of two linear equations is represented by an ordered pair (x, y).

To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two equations, we substitute the values of the variables into
each equation. If the ordered pair makes both equations true, it is a solution to the system.

Solve a System of Linear Equations by Graphing

In this section, we will use three methods to solve a system of linear equations. The first method we’ll use is graphing.

The graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two equations,
we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And, by finding what the lines
have in common, we’ll find the solution to the system.

Most linear equations in one variable have one solution, but we saw that some equations, called contradictions, have no
solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers are solutions.

Similarly, when we solve a system of two linear equations represented by a graph of two lines in the same plane, there
are three possible cases, as shown.

Figure 4.2

Each time we demonstrate a new method, we will use it on the same system of linear equations. At the end of the section
you’ll decide which method was the most convenient way to solve this system.

When we graphed the second line in the last example, we drew it right over the first line. We say the two lines are
coincident. Coincident lines have the same slope and same y-intercept.

Coincident Lines

Coincident lines have the same slope and same y-intercept.

The systems of equations in Example 4.2 and Example 4.3 each had two intersecting lines. Each system had one solution.

In Example 4.5, the equations gave coincident lines, and so the system had infinitely many solutions.

The systems in those three examples had at least one solution. A system of equations that has at least one solution is
called a consistent system.

A system with parallel lines, like Example 4.4, has no solution. We call a system of equations like this inconsistent. It has no
solution.

Consistent and Inconsistent Systems

A consistent system of equations is a system of equations with at least one solution.

An inconsistent system of equations is a system of equations with no solution.

We also categorize the equations in a system of equations by calling the equations independent or dependent. If two

If two equations are dependent, all the solutions of one equation are also solutions of the other equation. When we graph

Solving systems of linear equations by graphing is a good way to visualize the types of solutions that may result. However,
there are many cases where solving a system by graphing is inconvenient or imprecise. If the graphs extend beyond the
small grid with x and y both between −10 and 10, graphing the lines may be cumbersome. And if the solutions to the
system are not integers, it can be hard to read their values precisely from a graph.

Solve a System of Equations by Substitution

We will now solve systems of linear equations by the substitution method.

We will use the same system we used first for graphing.

⎧
2x + y = 7
⎨
x − 2y = 6
⎩

We will first solve one of the equations for either x or y. We can choose either equation and solve for either variable—but
we’ll try to make a choice that will keep the work easy.

Then we substitute that expression into the other equation. The result is an equation with just one variable—and we know
how to solve those!

After we find the value of one variable, we will substitute that value into one of the original equations and solve for the
other variable. Finally, we check our solution and make sure it makes both equations true.

Solve a System of Equations by Elimination

We have solved systems of linear equations by graphing and by substitution. Graphing works well when the variable
coefficients are small and the solution has integer values. Substitution works well when we can easily solve one equation

for one of the variables and not have too many fractions in the resulting expression.

The third method of solving systems of linear equations is called the Elimination Method. When we solved a system by
substitution, we started with two equations and two variables and reduced it to one equation with one variable. This is
what we’ll do with the elimination method, too, but we’ll have a different way to get there.

The Elimination Method is based on the Addition Property of Equality. The Addition Property of Equality says that when
you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality. We will extend the Addition Property of
Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the results are equal.

For any expressions a, b, c, and d.

if
and
then

a = b
c = d
a + c = b + d.

To solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we decide which
variable will be easiest to eliminate. How do we decide? We want to have the coefficients of one variable be opposites, so
that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable.

Notice how that works when we add these two equations together:

⎨
⎩

3x + y = 5
2x − y = 0
—————
= 5
5x

The y’s add to zero and we have one equation with one variable.

Let’s try another one:

⎧
x + 4y = 2
⎨
2x + 5y = −2
⎩

This time we don’t see a variable that can be immediately eliminated if we add the equations.

But if we multiply the first equation by −2, we will make the coefficients of x opposites. We must multiply every term on
both sides of the equation by −2.

Then rewrite the system of equations.

Now we see that the coefficients of the x terms are opposites, so x will be eliminated when we add these two equations.

Once we get an equation with just one variable, we solve it. Then we substitute that value into one of the original
equations to solve for the remaining variable. And, as always, we check our answer to make sure it is a solution to both of
the original equations.

Now we’ll see how to use elimination to solve the same system of equations we solved by graphing and by substitution.

Step 3.

Add the equations resulting from Step 2 to eliminate one variable.

Step 4.

Solve for the remaining variable.

Step 5.

Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations. Then solve for the other
variable.

Step 6.

Write the solution as an ordered pair.

Step 7.

Now we’ll do an example where we need to multiply both equations by constants in order to make the coefficients of one
variable opposites.

EXAMPLE 4.10

Solve the system by elimination:

⎧
4x − 3y = 9
⎨
.
7x + 2y = −6
⎩

Solution

In this example, we cannot multiply just one equation by any constant to get opposite coefficients. So we will strategically
multiply both equations by different constants to get the opposites.

Both equations are in standard form.
To get opposite coefficients of y, we will
multiply the first equation by 2 and the
second equation by 3.

Simplify.

Add the two equations to eliminate y.

Solve for x.

Substitute x = 0 into one of the original equations.

Solve for y.

Write the solution as an ordered pair.

The ordered pair is (0, −3).

Check that the ordered pair is a solution to
both original equations.

The solution is (0, −3).

⎧

When the system of equations contains fractions, we will first clear the fractions by multiplying each equation by the LCD
of all the fractions in the equation.

In this example, both equations have fractions. Our first step will be to multiply each equation by the LCD of all the
fractions in the equation to clear the fractions.

To clear the fractions, multiply each
equation by its LCD.

Simplify.

Now we are ready to eliminate one
of the variables. Notice that both equations are in
standard form.

We can eliminate y by multiplying the top equation by −4.

Simplify and add.

Substitute x = 3 into one of the original equations.

Solve for y .

When we solved the system by graphing, we saw that not all systems of linear equations have a single ordered pair
as a solution. When the two equations were really the same line, there were infinitely many solutions. We called that a
consistent system. When the two equations described parallel lines, there was no solution. We called that an inconsistent
system.

The same is true using substitution or elimination. If the equation at the end of substitution or elimination is a true
statement, we have a consistent but dependent system and the system of equations has infinitely many solutions. If the
equation at the end of substitution or elimination is a false statement, we have an inconsistent system and the system of
equations has no solution.

This is a true statement. The equations are consistent but dependent. Their graphs would be the same line. The system

we have coincident lines.

Solve Direct Translation Applications

Systems of linear equations are very useful for solving applications. Some people find setting up word problems with two
variables easier than setting them up with just one variable. To solve an application, we’ll first translate the words into a

Solve Geometry Applications

We will now solve geometry applications using systems of linear equations. We will need to add complementary angles
and supplementary angles to our list some properties of angles.

degrees.

Complementary and Supplementary Angles

Two angles are complementary if the sum of the measures of their angles is 90 degrees.

Two angles are supplementary if the sum of the measures of their angles is 180 degrees.

If two angles are complementary, we say that one angle is the complement of the other.

If two angles are supplementary, we say that one angle is the supplement of the other.

Solve uniform motion applications

We used a table to organize the information in uniform motion problems when we introduced them earlier. We’ll continue
using the table here. The basic equation was D = rt where D is the distance traveled, r is the rate, and t is the time.

Our first example of a uniform motion application will be for a situation similar to some we have already seen, but now
we can use two variables and two equations.

EXAMPLE 4.21

Translate to a system of equations and then solve:

Joni left St. Louis on the interstate, driving west towards Denver at a speed of 65 miles per hour. Half an hour later, Kelly
left St. Louis on the same route as Joni, driving 78 miles per hour. How long will it take Kelly to catch up to Joni?

Solution

A diagram is useful in helping us visualize the situation.

Identify and name what we are looking for. A chart will help us organize the data. We know the rates of both Joni and
Kelly, and so we enter them in the chart. We are looking for the length of time Kelly, k, and Joni, j, will each drive.

Since D = r · t we can fill in the Distance column.

Translate into a system of equations.

To make the system of equations, we must recognize that Kelly and Joni will drive the same distance. So,

Many real-world applications of uniform motion arise because of the effects of currents—of water or air—on the actual
speed of a vehicle. Cross-country airplane flights in the United States generally take longer going west than going east
because of the prevailing wind currents.

Let’s take a look at a boat travelling on a river. Depending on which way the boat is going, the current of the water is
either slowing it down or speeding it up.

The images below show how a river current affects the speed at which a boat is actually travelling. We’ll call the speed of
the boat in still water b and the speed of the river current c.

400

Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations

The boat is going downstream, in the same direction as the river current. The current helps push the boat, so the boat’s
actual speed is faster than its speed in still water. The actual speed at which the boat is moving is b + c.

Now, the boat is going upstream, opposite to the river current. The current is going against the boat, so the boat’s actual
speed is slower than its speed in still water. The actual speed of the boat is b − c.

We’ll put some numbers to this situation in the next example.

EXAMPLE 4.22

Translate to a system of equations and then solve.

A river cruise ship sailed 60 miles downstream for 4 hours and then took 5 hours sailing upstream to return to the dock.
Find the speed of the ship in still water and the speed of the river current.

Solution

Read the problem.

This is a uniform motion problem and a
picture will help us visualize the situation.

Identify what we are looking for.

Name what we are looking for.

We are looking for the speed of the ship
in still water and the speed of the current.

Let s = the rate of the ship in still water.

c = the rate of the current

A chart will help us organize the information.
The ship goes downstream and then upstream.
Going downstream, the current helps the
ship and so the ship's actual rate is s + c.
Going upstream, the current slows the ship
and so the actual rate is s − c.

Downstream it takes 4 hours.
Upstream it takes 5 hours.
Each way the distance is 60 miles.

Translate into a system of equations.
Since rate times time is distance, we can
write the system of equations.

Solve the system of equations.
Distribute to put both equations in standard
form, then solve by elimination.

Multiply the top equation by 5 and the
bottom equation by 4.
Add the equations, then solve for s.

Substitute s = 13.5 into of the original
equations.

Check the answer in the problem.
The downstream rate would be

13.5 + 1.5 = 15 mph.

In 4 hours the ship would travel

15 · 4 = 60 miles.
The upstream rate would be
13.5 − 1.5 = 12 mph.

In 5 hours the ship would travel

12 · 5 = 60 miles.

Answer the question.

The rate of the ship is 13.5 mph and
the rate of the current is 1.5 mph.

Wind currents affect airplane speeds in the same way as water currents affect boat speeds. We’ll see this in the next
example. A wind current in the same direction as the plane is flying is called a tailwind. A wind current blowing against the
direction of the plane is called a headwind.

EXAMPLE 4.23

Translate to a system of equations and then solve:

A private jet can fly 1,095 miles in three hours with a tailwind but only 987 miles in three hours into a headwind. Find the
speed of the jet in still air and the speed of the wind.

Solution

Read the problem.

This is a uniform motion problem and a
picture will help us visualize.

Identify what we are looking for.

We are looking for the speed of the jet
in still air and the speed of the wind.

Name what we are looking for.

Let j = the speed of the jet in still air.

w = the speed of the wind.

A chart will help us organize the information.
The jet makes two trips—one in a tailwind
and one in a headwind.
In a tailwind, the wind helps the jet and so
the rate is j + w.
In a headwind, the wind slows the jet and
so the rate is j ‒ w.

Each trip takes 3 hours.
In a tailwind the jet flies 1,095 miles.
In a headwind the jet flies 987 miles.

Translate into a system of equations.
Since rate times time is distance, we get the

4.3 Solve Mixture Applications with Systems of Equations

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Solve mixture applications
Solve interest applications
Solve applications of cost and revenue functions

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Multiply: 4.025(1,562).

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.36.

2. Write 8.2% as a decimal.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.40.

3. Earl’s dinner bill came to $32.50 and he wanted to leave an 18% tip. How much should the tip be?

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.20.

Solve Mixture Applications

Mixture application involve combining two or more quantities. When we solved mixture applications with coins and tickets
earlier, we started by creating a table so we could organize the information. For a coin example with nickels and dimes,
the table looked like this:

Using one variable meant that we had to relate the number of nickels and the number of dimes. We had to decide if we
were going to let n be the number of nickels and then write the number of dimes in terms of n, or if we would let d be the
number of dimes and write the number of nickels in terms of d.

Now that we know how to solve systems of equations with two variables, we’ll just let n be the number of nickels and
d be the number of dimes. We’ll write one equation based on the total value column, like we did before, and the other
equation will come from the number column.

For the first example, we’ll do a ticket problem where the ticket prices are in whole dollars, so we won’t need to use
decimals just yet.

EXAMPLE 4.24

Translate to a system of equations and solve:

A science center sold 1,363 tickets on a busy weekend. The receipts totaled $12,146. How many $12 adult tickets and how
many $7 child tickets were sold?

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.

We will create a table to organize the information.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for.

A table will help us organize the data.
We have two types of tickets, adult and child.

We are looking for the number of adult tickets
and the number of child tickets sold.

Let a = the number of adult tickets.
c = the number of child tickets

Write in a and c for the number of tickets.

408

Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations

Write the total number of tickets sold at the bottom
of the Number column.

Altogether 1,363 were sold.

Write the value of each type of ticket in the
Value column.

The value of each adult ticket is $12.
The value of each child tickets is $7.

The number times the value gives the total value,
so the total value of adult tickets is a · 12 = 12a,
and the total value of child tickets is c · 7 = 7c.

Altogether the total value of the tickets was $12,146.

Fill in the Total Value column.

Step 4. Translate into a system of equations.

The Number column and the Total value column
give us the system of equations.

We will use the elimination method to solve
this system. Multiply the first equation by −7.

Simplify and add, then solve for a.

Substitute a = 521 into the first equation, then
solve for c.

Step 6. Check the answer in the
problem.
521 adult at $12 per ticket makes $ 6,252
842 child at $7 per ticket makes $58,994

The total receipts are $12,146✓

Step 7. Answer the question.

The science center sold 521 adult tickets and
842 child tickets.

EXAMPLE 4.25

Translate to a system of equations and solve:

Juan has a pocketful of nickels and dimes. The total value of the coins is $8.10. The number of dimes is 9 less than twice
the number of nickels. How many nickels and how many dimes does Juan have?

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.
We will create a table to organize the information.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for.

We are looking for the number of
nickels and the number of dimes.

Let n = the number of nickels.
d = the number of dimes

A table will help us organize the data.
We have two types of coins, nickels and dimes.

Write n and d for the number of
each type of coin.

Fill in the Value column with the value of each
type of coin.

The value of each nickel is $0.05.
The value of each dime is $0.10.

The number times the value gives the total
value, so, the total value of the nickels is
n(0.05) = 0.05n and the total value of dimes is
d(0.10) = 0.10d.
Altogether the total value of the coins is $8.10.

Step 4. Translate into a system of equations.

The Total Value column gives one equation.

We also know the number of dimes is 9 less than
twice the number of nickels.

Translate to get the second equation.

Now we have the system to solve.

Step 5. Solve the system of equations
We will use the substitution method.

Substitute d = 2n − 9 into the first equation.

Simplify and solve for n.

To find the number of dimes, substitute
n = 36 into the second equation.

Step 6. Check the answer in the problem

63 dimes at $0.10 = $6.30
36 nickels at $0.05 = $1.80

Total = $8.10 ✓

Step 7. Answer the question.

Juan has 36 nickels and 63 dimes.

Some mixture applications involve combining foods or drinks. Example situations might include combining raisins and
nuts to make a trail mix or using two types of coffee beans to make a blend.

EXAMPLE 4.26

Translate to a system of equations and solve:

Carson wants to make 20 pounds of trail mix using nuts and chocolate chips. His budget requires that the trail mix costs
him $7.60. per pound. Nuts cost $9.00 per pound and chocolate chips cost $2.00 per pound. How many pounds of nuts
and how many pounds of chocolate chips should he use?

We are looking for the number of pounds of
nuts and the number of pounds of chocolate
chips.

Let n = the number of pound of nuts.

c = the number of pounds of chips

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.
We will create a table to organize the information.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for.

Carson will mix nuts and chocolate chips to get
trail mix.
Write in n and c for the number of pounds of
nuts and chocolate chips.

There will be 20 pounds of trail mix.
Put the price per pound of each item in
the Value column.
Fill in the last column using

Number • Value = Total Value

Step 4. Translate into a system of equations.
We get the equations from the Number
and Total Value columns.

Step 5. Solve the system of equations
We will use elimination to solve the system.
Multiply the first equation by −2 to eliminate c.

Simplify and add.
Solve for n.

her $6 per pound. Peanuts are $4 per pound and cashews are $9 per pound. How many pounds of peanuts and
how many pounds of cashews should she use?

TRY IT : : 4.52

Translate to a system of equations and solve:

Sammy has most of the ingredients he needs to make a large batch of chili. The only items he lacks are beans
and ground beef. He needs a total of 20 pounds combined of beans and ground beef and has a budget of $3 per
pound. The price of beans is $1 per pound and the price of ground beef is $5 per pound. How many pounds of
beans and how many pounds of ground beef should he purchase?

Another application of mixture problems relates to concentrated cleaning supplies, other chemicals, and mixed drinks.
The concentration is given as a percent. For example, a 20% concentrated household cleanser means that 20% of the total
amount is cleanser, and the rest is water. To make 35 ounces of a 20% concentration, you mix 7 ounces (20% of 35) of the
cleanser with 28 ounces of water.

For these kinds of mixture problems, we’ll use “percent” instead of “value” for one of the columns in our table.

EXAMPLE 4.27

Translate to a system of equations and solve:

Sasheena is lab assistant at her community college. She needs to make 200 milliliters of a 40% solution of sulfuric acid for
a lab experiment. The lab has only 25% and 50% solutions in the storeroom. How much should she mix of the 25% and the
50% solutions to make the 40% solution?

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.
A figure may help us visualize the
situation, then we will create a table to
organize the information.

Sasheena must mix some of the 25% solution and
some of the 50% solution together to get 200 ml of
the 40% solution.

412

Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

We are looking for how much of each solution she
needs.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for.

Let x = number of ml of 25% solution.
y = number of ml of 50% solution

A table will help us organize the data. She will
mix x ml of 25% with y ml of 50% to get 200 ml
of 40% solution. We write the percents as decimals
in the chart.
We multiply the number of units times the
concentration to get the total amount of
sulfuric acid in each solution.

Step 4. Translate into a system of
equations.
We get the equations from the Number
column and the Amount column.
Now we have the system.

Step 5. Solve the system of equations
We will solve the system by elimination.
Multiply the first equation by −0.5 to
eliminate y.

Simplify and add to solve for x.

To solve for y, substitute x = 80 into the first
equation.

Step 6. Check the answer in the problem.
80 + 120 = 200 ✓
0.25(80) + 0.50(120) = 200 ✓

Yes!

Step 7. Answer the question.

Sasheena should mix 80 ml of the 25% solution with
120 ml of the 50% solution to get the 200 ml of the
40% solution.

We modify the column titles in the mixture table to show the formula for interest, as you’ll see in the next example.

EXAMPLE 4.28

Translate to a system of equations and solve:

Adnan has $40,000 to invest and hopes to earn 7.1% interest per year. He will put some of the money into a stock fund
that earns 8% per year and the rest into bonds that earns 3% per year. How much money should he put into each fund?

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.

A chart will help us organize the information.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the amount to invest in each fund.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for.

Let s = the amount invested in stocks.
b = the amount invested in stocks

Write the interest rate as a decimal for
each fund.
Multiply: Principal · Rate · Time

Step 4. Translate into a system of
equations.
We get our system of equations from
the Principal column and the
Interest column.

Step 5. Solve the system of equations
by elimination.
Multiply the top equation by −0.03.

Simplify and add to solve for s.

To find b, substitute s = 32,800 into
the first equation.

Step 6. Check the answer in the
problem.

Step 7. Answer the question.

We leave the check to you.

Adnan should invest $32,800 in stock and
$7,200 in bonds.

Did you notice that the Principal column represents the total amount of money invested while the Interest column
represents only the interest earned? Likewise, the first equation in our system, s + b = 40,000,
represents the total
amount of money invested and the second equation, 0.08s + 0.03b = 0.071(40,000),

represents the interest earned.

Solve applications of cost and revenue functions

Suppose a company makes and sells x units of a product. The cost to the company is the total costs to produce x units.
This is the cost to manufacture for each unit times x, the number of units manufactured, plus the fixed costs.

The revenue is the money the company brings in as a result of selling x units. This is the selling price of each unit times
the number of units sold.

When the costs equal the revenue we say the business has reached the break-even point.

Cost and Revenue Functions

The cost function is the cost to manufacture each unit times x, the number of units manufactured, plus the fixed
costs.

C(x) = ⎛

⎝cost per unit⎞

⎠ · x + fixed costs

The revenue function is the selling price of each unit times x, the number of units sold.

R(x) = ⎛

⎝selling price per unit⎞

⎠ · x

The break-even point is when the revenue equals the costs.

C(x) = R(x)

EXAMPLE 4.30

The manufacturer of a weight training bench spends $105 to build each bench and sells them for $245. The manufacturer
also has fixed costs each month of $7,000.

ⓐ Find the cost function C when x benches are manufactured.

ⓑ Find the revenue function R when x benches are sold.

ⓒ Show the break-even point by graphing both the Revenue and Cost functions on the same grid.

ⓓ Find the break-even point. Interpret what the break-even point means.

Solution

ⓐ The manufacturer has $7,000 of fixed costs no matter how many weight training benches it produces. In addition to
the fixed costs, the manufacturer also spends $105 to produce each bench. Suppose x benches are sold.
C(x) = ⎛
⎝cost per unit⎞
C(x) = 105x + 7000

Write the general Cost function formula.
Substitute in the cost values.

⎠ · x + fixed costs

ⓑ The manufacturer sells each weight training bench for $245. We get the total revenue by multiplying the revenue per
unit times the number of units sold.

Write the general Revenue function.
Substitute in the revenue per unit.

⎝selling price per unit⎞

⎠ · x

R(x) = ⎛
R(x) = 245x

ⓒ Essentially we have a system of linear equations. We will show the graph of the system as this helps make the idea of a
break-even point more visual.

Determine Whether an Ordered Triple is a Solution of a System of Three Linear
Equations with Three Variables

In this section, we will extend our work of solving a system of linear equations. So far we have worked with systems of
equations with two equations and two variables. Now we will work with systems of three equations with three variables.
But first let's review what we already know about solving equations and systems involving up to two variables.

We learned earlier that the graph of a linear equation, ax + by = c,
(x, y),
see that all the points that are solutions to each equation form a line. And, by finding what the lines have in common, we’ll
find the solution to the system.

Most linear equations in one variable have one solution, but we saw that some equations, called contradictions, have no
solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers are solutions

We know when we solve a system of two linear equations represented by a graph of two lines in the same plane, there
are three possible cases, as shown.

Similarly, for a linear equation with three variables ax + by + cz = d, every solution to the equation is an ordered triple,
(x, y, z) that makes the equation true.

Linear Equation in Three Variables

A linear equation with three variables, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers and a, b, and c are not all 0, is of the form

Every solution to the equation is an ordered triple, (x, y, z) that makes the equation true.

ax + by + cz = d

All the points that are solutions to one equation form a plane in three-dimensional space. And, by finding what the planes
have in common, we’ll find the solution to the system.

When we solve a system of three linear equations represented by a graph of three planes in space, there are three
possible cases.

To solve a system of three linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions to all three
equations. In other words, we are looking for the ordered triple (x, y, z) that makes all three equations true. These are
called the solutions of the system of three linear equations with three variables.

Solutions of a System of Linear Equations with Three Variables

Solutions of a system of equations are the values of the variables that make all the equations true. A solution is
represented by an ordered triple (x, y, z).

To determine if an ordered triple is a solution to a system of three equations, we substitute the values of the variables into
each equation. If the ordered triple makes all three equations true, it is a solution to the system.

EXAMPLE 4.31

Determine whether the ordered triple is a solution to the system:

Solve a System of Linear Equations with Three Variables

To solve a system of linear equations with three variables, we basically use the same techniques we used with systems
that had two variables. We start with two pairs of equations and in each pair we eliminate the same variable. This will then
give us a system of equations with only two variables and then we know how to solve that system!

Next, we use the values of the two variables we just found to go back to the original equation and find the third variable.
We write our answer as an ordered triple and then check our results.

HOW TO : : SOLVE A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS WITH THREE VARIABLES.

Step 1.

Write the equations in standard form

◦

If any coefficients are fractions, clear them.

Step 2.

Eliminate the same variable from two equations.

◦ Decide which variable you will eliminate.

◦ Work with a pair of equations to eliminate the chosen variable.

◦ Multiply one or both equations so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.

◦ Add the equations resulting from Step 2 to eliminate one variable

Step 3.

Repeat Step 2 using two other equations and eliminate the same variable as in Step 2.

Step 4.

The two new equations form a system of two equations with two variables. Solve this system.

Step 5.

Use the values of the two variables found in Step 4 to find the third variable.

Step 6.

Write the solution as an ordered triple.

Step 7.

Check that the ordered triple is a solution to all three original equations.

EXAMPLE 4.33

Solve:

⎧
⎨
⎩

3x − 4z = 0
3y + 2z = −3
.
2x + 3y = −5

Solution

(1)
3x − 4z = 0
3y + 2z = −3 (2)
2x + 3y = −5 (3)
We can eliminate z from equations (1) and (2) by multiplying equation (2) by 2 and then adding the resulting equations.

⎧
⎨
⎩

Notice that equations (3) and (4) both have the variables x and y . We will solve this new system for x and y .

To solve for y, we substitute x = −4 into equation (3).

We now have x = −4 and y = 1. We need to solve for z. We can substitute x = −4 into equation (1) to find z.

When we solve a system and end up with no variables and a false statement, we know there are no solutions and that the
system is inconsistent. The next example shows a system of equations that is inconsistent.

EXAMPLE 4.34

Solve the system of equations:

⎧

x + 2y − 3z = −1
x − 3y + z = 1

⎧

⎩

x + 2y − 3z = −1 (1)
(2)
x − 3y + z = 1
(3)
2x − y − 2z = 2

Use equation (1) and (2) to eliminate z.

Use (2) and (3) to eliminate z again.

Use (4) and (5) to eliminate a variable.

There is no solution.

We are left with a false statement and this tells us the system is inconsistent and has no solution.

.

When we solve a system and end up with no variables but a true statement, we know there are infinitely many solutions.
The system is consistent with dependent equations. Our solution will show how two of the variables depend on the third.

EXAMPLE 4.35

Solve the system of equations:

⎧
⎨
⎩

x + 2y − z = 1
2x + 7y + 4z = 11
x + 3y + z = 4

.

Solution

Use equation (1) and (3) to eliminate x.

⎧
⎨
⎩

(1)
x + 2y − z = 1
2x + 7y + 4z = 11 (2)
(3)
x + 3y + z = 4

Use equation (1) and (2) to eliminate x again.

Use equation (4) and (5) to eliminate y .

There are infinitely many solutions.

Solve equation (4) for y.

Represent the solution showing how x and y are dependent on z.
y + 2z = 3

y = −2z + 3

Use equation (1) to solve for x.

x + 2y − z = 1

Substitute y = −2z + 3.

x + 2(−2z + 3) − z = 1

x − 4z + 6 − z = 1

x − 5z + 6 = 1

x = 5z − 5

The true statement 0 = 0 tells us that this is a dependent system that has infinitely many solutions. The solutions are of
the form (x, y, z) where x = 5z − 5; y = −2z + 3 and z is any real number.

Solve Applications using Systems of Linear Equations with Three Variables

Applications that are modeled by a systems of equations can be solved using the same techniques we used to solve the
systems. Many of the application are just extensions to three variables of the types we have solved earlier.

EXAMPLE 4.36

for $15, the student tickets for $10 and the child tickets for $8. The theater department was thrilled to have sold 250 tickets
and brought in $2,825 in one night. The number of student tickets sold is twice the number of adult tickets sold. How
many of each type did the department sell?

Solution

We will use a chart to organize the
information.

Number of students is twice
number of adults.

2x − y = 0

Use equations (1) and (2) to

x + y + z = 250

Substitute in the values
x = 75, y = 150.

75 + 150 + z = 250

Write the Augmented Matrix for a System of Equations

Solving a system of equations can be a tedious operation where a simple mistake can wreak havoc on finding the solution.
An alternative method which uses the basic procedures of elimination but with notation that is simpler is available. The
method involves using a matrix. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Matrix

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

A matrix with m rows and n columns has order m × n. The matrix on the left below has 2 rows and 3 columns and so
it has order 2 × 3. We say it is a 2 by 3 matrix.

Each number in the matrix is called an element or entry in the matrix.

We will use a matrix to represent a system of linear equations. We write each equation in standard form and the
coefficients of the variables and the constant of each equation becomes a row in the matrix. Each column then would be
the coefficients of one of the variables in the system or the constants. A vertical line replaces the equal signs. We call the
resulting matrix the augmented matrix for the system of equations.

Notice the first column is made up of all the coefficients of x, the second column is the all the coefficients of y, and the
third column is all the constants.

EXAMPLE 4.37

Write each system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:

⎩

6x − 5y + 2z = 3
2x + y − 4z = 5
3x − 3y + z = −1

Solution

ⓐ The second equation is not in standard form. We rewrite the second equation in standard form.

y = 2x − 2

−2x + y = −2

We replace the second equation with its standard form. In the augmented matrix, the first equation gives us the first row
and the second equation gives us the second row. The vertical line replaces the equal signs.

ⓑ All three equations are in standard form. In the augmented matrix the first equation gives us the first row, the second
equation gives us the second row, and the third equation gives us the third row. The vertical line replaces the equal signs.

It is important as we solve systems of equations using matrices to be able to go back and forth between the system and
the matrix. The next example asks us to take the information in the matrix and write the system of equations.

We remember that each row corresponds to an equation and that each entry is a coefficient of a variable or the constant.
The vertical line replaces the equal sign. Since this matrix is a 4 × 3 , we know it will translate into a system of three
equations with three variables.

Use Row Operations on a Matrix

Once a system of equations is in its augmented matrix form, we will perform operations on the rows that will lead us to
the solution.

To solve by elimination, it doesn’t matter which order we place the equations in the system. Similarly, in the matrix we can
interchange the rows.

When we solve by elimination, we often multiply one of the equations by a constant. Since each row represents an
equation, and we can multiply each side of an equation by a constant, similarly we can multiply each entry in a row by any
real number except 0.

In elimination, we often add a multiple of one row to another row. In the matrix we can replace a row with its sum with a
multiple of another row.

These actions are called row operations and will help us use the matrix to solve a system of equations.

Row Operations

In a matrix, the following operations can be performed on any row and the resulting matrix will be equivalent to the
original matrix.

1.

Interchange any two rows.

2. Multiply a row by any real number except 0.

3. Add a nonzero multiple of one row to another row.

Performing these operations is easy to do but all the arithmetic can result in a mistake. If we use a system to record the
row operation in each step, it is much easier to go back and check our work.

We use capital letters with subscripts to represent each row. We then show the operation to the left of the new matrix. To
show interchanging a row:

To multiply row 2 by −3 and add it to row 1:

Now that we have practiced the row operations, we will look at an augmented matrix and figure out what operation we
will use to reach a goal. This is exactly what we did when we did elimination. We decided what number to multiply a row
by in order that a variable would be eliminated when we added the rows together.

Given this system, what would you do to eliminate x?

This next example essentially does the same thing, but to the matrix.

Solve Systems of Equations Using Matrices

To solve a system of equations using matrices, we transform the augmented matrix into a matrix in row-echelon form
using row operations. For a consistent and independent system of equations, its augmented matrix is in row-echelon
form when to the left of the vertical line, each entry on the diagonal is a 1 and all entries below the diagonal are zeros.

Row-Echelon Form

For a consistent and independent system of equations, its augmented matrix is in row-echelon form when to the left
of the vertical line, each entry on the diagonal is a 1 and all entries below the diagonal are zeros.

Once we get the augmented matrix into row-echelon form, we can write the equivalent system of equations and read
the value of at least one variable. We then substitute this value in another equation to continue to solve for the other
variables. This process is illustrated in the next example.

exactly one solution. Let’s now look at what happens when we use a matrix for a dependent or inconsistent system.

we have an inconsistent system. There is no solution.

Evaluate the Determinant of a 2 × 2 Matrix

If a matrix has the same number of rows and columns, we call it a square matrix. Each square matrix has a real number

associated with it called its determinant. To find the determinant of the square matrix

⎡
a
⎣
c

b
d

⎤
⎦, we first write it as

|a

c

b

d|. To get the real number value of the determinate we subtract the products of the diagonals, as shown.

Evaluate the Determinant of a 3 × 3 Matrix

To evaluate the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix, we have to be able to evaluate the minor of an entry in the determinant.
The minor of an entry is the 2 × 2 determinant found by eliminating the row and column in the 3 × 3 determinant that
contains the entry.

Minor of an entry in 3 × 3 a Determinant

The minor of an entry in a 3 × 3 determinant is the 2 × 2 determinant found by eliminating the row and column in
the 3 × 3 determinant that contains the entry.

To find the minor of entry a1, we eliminate the row and column which contain it. So we eliminate the first row and first
column. Then we write the 2 × 2 determinant that remains.

To find the minor of entry b2, we eliminate the row and column that contain it. So we eliminate the 2nd row and 2nd
column. Then we write the 2 × 2 determinant that remains.

We are now ready to evaluate a 3 × 3 determinant. To do this we expand by minors, which allows us to evaluate the
3 × 3 determinant using 2 × 2 determinants—which we already know how to evaluate!

To evaluate a 3 × 3 determinant by expanding by minors along the first row, we use the following pattern:

Remember, to find the minor of an entry we eliminate the row and column that contains the entry.

Expanding by Minors along the First Row to Evaluate a 3 × 3 Determinant

To evaluate a 3 × 3 determinant we can expand by minors using any row or column. Choosing a row or column other
than the first row sometimes makes the work easier.

When we expand by any row or column, we must be careful about the sign of the terms in the expansion. To determine
the sign of the terms, we use the following sign pattern chart.

When expanding by minors using a row or column, the sign of the terms in the expansion follow the following pattern.

Notice that the sign pattern in the first row matches the signs between the terms in the expansion by the first row.

Since we can expand by any row or column, how do we decide which row or column to use? Usually we try to pick a row or
column that will make our calculation easier. If the determinant contains a 0, using the row or column that contains the 0
will make the calculations easier.

Use Cramer’s Rule to Solve Systems of Equations

Cramer’s Rule is a method of solving systems of equations using determinants. It can be derived by solving the general
form of the systems of equations by elimination. Here we will demonstrate the rule for both systems of two equations
with two variables and for systems of three equations with three variables.

Let’s start with the systems of two equations with two variables.

Cramer’s Rule for Solving a System of Two Equations

For the system of equations

⎧
a1 x + b1 y = k1
⎨
a2 x + b2 y = k2
⎩

the solution (x, y) can be determined by

Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations

Notice that to form the determinant D, we use take the coefficients of the variables.

Notice that to form the determinant D x and D y, we substitute the constants for the coefficients of the variable we are
finding.

HOW TO : : SOLVE A SYSTEM OF TWO EQUATIONS USING CRAMER’S RULE.

Step 1.

Evaluate the determinant D, using the coefficients of the variables.

Step 5.

To solve a system of three equations with three variables with Cramer’s Rule, we basically do what we did for a system of
two equations. However, we now have to solve for three variables to get the solution. The determinants are also going to
be 3 × 3 which will make our work more interesting!

Cramer’s Rule for Solving a System of Three Equations

Cramer’s rule does not work when the value of the D determinant is 0, as this would mean we would be dividing by 0. But
when D = 0,

the system is either inconsistent or dependent.

When the value of D = 0 and D x, D y and Dz are all zero, the system is consistent and dependent and there are
infinitely many solutions.

When the value of D = 0 and D x, D y and Dz are not all zero, the system is inconsistent and there is no solution.

Dependent and Inconsistent Systems of Equations

If you missed this problem, review Example 3.34.

Determine whether an ordered pair is a solution of a system of linear inequalities

The definition of a system of linear inequalities is very similar to the definition of a system of linear equations.

System of Linear Inequalities

Two or more linear inequalities grouped together form a system of linear inequalities.

A system of linear inequalities looks like a system of linear equations, but it has inequalities instead of equations. A system
of two linear inequalities is shown here.

⎧
x + 4y ≥ 10
⎨
3x − 2y < 12
⎩

To solve a system of linear inequalities, we will find values of the variables that are solutions to both inequalities. We solve
the system by using the graphs of each inequality and show the solution as a graph. We will find the region on the plane
that contains all ordered pairs (x, y) that make both inequalities true.

Solutions of a System of Linear Inequalities

Solutions of a system of linear inequalities are the values of the variables that make all the inequalities true.

The solution of a system of linear inequalities is shown as a shaded region in the x, y coordinate system that includes
all the points whose ordered pairs make the inequalities true.

To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two inequalities, we substitute the values of the variables into
each inequality. If the ordered pair makes both inequalities true, it is a solution to the system.

461

The ordered pair (−2, 4) made both inequalities true. Therefore (−2, 4) is a solution to this system.

ⓑ Is the ordered pair (3, 1) a solution?

The ordered pair (3, 1) made one inequality true, but the other one false. Therefore (3, 1) is not a solution to this
system.

Solve a System of Linear Inequalities by Graphing

The solution to a single linear inequality is the region on one side of the boundary line that contains all the points that
make the inequality true. The solution to a system of two linear inequalities is a region that contains the solutions to both
inequalities. To find this region, we will graph each inequality separately and then locate the region where they are both
true. The solution is always shown as a graph.

HOW TO : : SOLVE A SYSTEM OF LINEAR INEQUALITIES BY GRAPHING.

Step 1.

Graph the first inequality.

◦ Graph the boundary line.

◦ Shade in the side of the boundary line where the inequality is true.

Step 2.

On the same grid, graph the second inequality.

◦ Graph the boundary line.

◦ Shade in the side of that boundary line where the inequality is true.

Step 3.

The solution is the region where the shading overlaps.

Step 4.

Check by choosing a test point.

and testing a point.

boundary line will be dashed.

(red) the side that does not contain (0, 0).

Solve Applications of Systems of Inequalities

The first thing we’ll need to do to solve applications of systems of inequalities is to translate each condition into an
inequality. Then we graph the system, as we did above, to see the region that contains the solutions. Many situations will
be realistic only if both variables are positive, so we add inequalities to the system as additional requirements.

EXAMPLE 4.59

Christy sells her photographs at a booth at a street fair. At the start of the day, she wants to have at least 25 photos to
display at her booth. Each small photo she displays costs her $4 and each large photo costs her $10. She doesn’t want to
spend more than $200 on photos to display.

ⓐ Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.
ⓑ Graph the system.
ⓒ Could she display 10 small and 20 large photos?
ⓓ Could she display 20 large and 10 small photos?

Solution

ⓐ
Let x = the number of small photos.
y = the number of large photos

Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations

469

She wants to have at least 25 photos.
The number of small plus the number of large should be at least 25.

x + y ≥ 25

$4 for each small and $10 for each large must be no more than $200

4x + 10y ≤ 200

The number of small photos must be greater than or equal to 0.

The number of large photos must be greater than or equal to 0.

x ≥ 0

We have our system of equations.

y ≥ 0

⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩

x + y ≥ 25
4x + 10y ≤ 200
x ≥ 0
y ≥ 0

ⓑ
Since x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (both are greater than or equal to) all solutions will be in the first quadrant. As a result, our graph
shows only quadrant one.

To graph x + y ≥ 25, graph x + y = 25 as a solid line.
Choose (0, 0) as a test point. Since it does not make the inequality
true, shade (red) the side that does not include the point (0, 0).

To graph 4x + 10y ≤ 200, graph 4x + 10y = 200 as a solid line.
Choose (0, 0) as a test point. Since it does make the inequality true,
shade (blue) the side that include the point (0, 0).

The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is shaded the darkest. The boundary line sections that border
the darkly-shaded section are included in the solution as are the points on the x-axis from (25, 0) to (55, 0).

ⓒ To determine if 10 small and 20 large photos would work, we look at the graph to see if the point (10, 20) is in the
solution region. We could also test the point to see if it is a solution of both equations.

It is not, Christy would not display 10 small and 20 large photos.

ⓓ To determine if 20 small and 10 large photos would work, we look at the graph to see if the point (20, 10) is in the
solution region. We could also test the point to see if it is a solution of both equations.

It is, so Christy could choose to display 20 small and 10 large photos.

Notice that we could also test the possible solutions by substituting the values into each inequality.

ⓐ Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.
ⓑ Graph the system.
ⓒ Could Mary purchase 100 pencils and 100 answer sheets?
ⓓ Could Mary purchase 150 pencils and 150 answer sheets?

When we use variables other than x and y to define an unknown quantity, we must change the names of the axes of the
graph as well.

EXAMPLE 4.60

Omar needs to eat at least 800 calories before going to his team practice. All he wants is hamburgers and cookies, and he
doesn’t want to spend more than $5. At the hamburger restaurant near his college, each hamburger has 240 calories and
costs $1.40. Each cookie has 160 calories and costs $0.50.

ⓐ Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.
ⓑ Graph the system.
ⓒ Could he eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie?
ⓓ Could he eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies?

Solution

ⓐ
Let h = the number of hamburgers.
c = the number of cookies

To find the system of equations translate the information.

The calories from hamburgers at 240 calories each, plus the calories from cookies at 160 calories each must be more that
800.

240h + 160c ≥ 800

The amount spent on hamburgers at $1.40 each, plus the amount spent on cookies
at $0.50 each must be no more than $5.00.

The number of hamburgers must be greater than or equal to 0.

1.40h + 0.50c ≤ 5

The number of cookies must be greater than or equal to 0.

h ≥ 0

We have our system of equations.

⎩

240h + 160c ≥ 800
1.40h + 0.50c ≤ 5

Since h > = 0 and c > = 0 (both are greater than or equal to) all solutions will be in the first quadrant. As a result,
our graph shows only quadrant one.

To graph 240h + 160c ≥ 800, graph 240h + 160c = 800 as a solid
line.

Choose (0, 0) as a test point. Since it does not make the inequality
true, shade (red) the side that does not include the point (0, 0).

Graph 1.40h + 0.50c ≤ 5. The boundary line is 1.40h + 0.50c = 5. We test (0, 0) and it makes the inequality true. We
shade the side of the line that includes (0, 0).

The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is shaded the darkest. The boundary line sections that border
the darkly shaded section are included in the solution as are the points on the x-axis from (5, 0) to (10, 0).

ⓒ To determine if 3 hamburgers and 2 cookies would meet Omar’s criteria, we see if the point (3, 2) is in the solution
region. It is, so Omar might choose to eat 3 hamburgers and 2 cookies.

ⓓ To determine if 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies would meet Omar’s criteria, we see if the point (2, 4) is in the solution
region. It is, Omar might choose to eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies.

Introduction

You may have coins and paper money in your wallet, but you may soon want to acquire a type of currency called bitcoins.
They exist only in a digital wallet on your computer. You can use bitcoins to pay for goods at some companies, or save
them as an investment. Although the future of bitcoins is uncertain, investment brokers are beginning to investigate ways
to make business predictions using this digital currency. Understanding how bitcoins are created and obtained requires
an understanding of a type of function known as a polynomial function. In this chapter you will investigate polynomials
and polynomial functions and learn how to perform mathematical operations on them.

Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions

Determine the Degree of Polynomials

We have learned that a term is a constant or the product of a constant and one or more variables. A monomial is an
algebraic expression with one term. When it is of the form axm, where a is a constant and m is a whole number, it is
called a monomial in one variable. Some examples of monomial in one variable are. Monomials can also have more than
one variable such as and −4a2 b3 c2.

Monomial

A monomial is an algebraic expression with one term.
A monomial in one variable is a term of the form axm, where a is a constant and m is a whole number.

A monomial, or two or more monomials combined by addition or subtraction, is a polynomial. Some polynomials have
special names, based on the number of terms. A monomial is a polynomial with exactly one term. A binomial has exactly
two terms, and a trinomial has exactly three terms. There are no special names for polynomials with more than three
terms.

Polynomials

polynomial—A monomial, or two or more algebraic terms combined by addition or subtraction is a polynomial.

monomial—A polynomial with exactly one term is called a monomial.

binomial—A polynomial with exactly two terms is called a binomial.

trinomial—A polynomial with exactly three terms is called a trinomial.

Here are some examples of polynomials.

9m2 + 2mn − 8n2

6k 4 − k 3 + 8k

−13a3 b2 c

3p3 q − 9p2 q

z4 + 3z2 − 1

Notice that every monomial, binomial, and trinomial is also a polynomial. They are just special members of the “family” of
polynomials and so they have special names. We use the words monomial, binomial, and trinomial when referring to these
special polynomials and just call all the rest polynomials.

The degree of a polynomial and the degree of its terms are determined by the exponents of the variable.

A monomial that has no variable, just a constant, is a special case. The degree of a constant is 0.

Degree of a Polynomial

The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of its variables.

The degree of a constant is 0.

The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of all its terms.

Let’s see how this works by looking at several polynomials. We’ll take it step by step, starting with monomials, and then
progressing to polynomials with more terms.

Let's start by looking at a monomial. The monomial 8ab2 has two variables a and b. To find the degree we need to find
the sum of the exponents. The variable a doesn't have an exponent written, but remember that means the exponent is 1.
The exponent of b is 2. The sum of the exponents, 1 + 2,

is 3 so the degree is 3.

Here are some additional examples.

Working with polynomials is easier when you list the terms in descending order of degrees. When a polynomial is written
this way, it is said to be in standard form of a polynomial. Get in the habit of writing the term with the highest degree
first.

Add and Subtract Polynomials

We have learned how to simplify expressions by combining like terms. Remember, like terms must have the same
variables with the same exponent. Since monomials are terms, adding and subtracting monomials is the same as
combining like terms. If the monomials are like terms, we just combine them by adding or subtracting the coefficients.

A polynomial function is a function whose range values are defined by a polynomial.

In Graphs and Functions, where we first introduced functions, we learned that evaluating a function means to find the

Simplify Expressions Using the Properties for Exponents
Remember that an exponent indicates repeated multiplication of the same quantity. For example, in the expression am,
the exponent m tells us how many times we use the base a as a factor.

Let’s review the vocabulary for expressions with exponents.

Exponential Notation

This is read a to the mth power.
In the expression am,

the exponent m tells us how many times we use the base a as a factor.

When we combine like terms by adding and subtracting, we need to have the same base with the same exponent. But
when you multiply and divide, the exponents may be different, and sometimes the bases may be different, too.

First, we will look at an example that leads to the Product Property.

What does this mean?

502

Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions

Notice that 5 is the sum of the exponents, 2 and 3. We see x2 · x3 is x2 + 3 or x5.
The base stayed the same and we added the exponents. This leads to the Product Property for Exponents.

Product Property for Exponents

If a is a real number and m and n are integers, then

am · an = am + n

To multiply with like bases, add the exponents.

EXAMPLE 5.12

Simplify each expression: ⓐ y5 · y6 ⓑ 2 x · 23x ⓒ 2a7 · 3a.

factors in the numerator have been removed, remember this is really dividing the factors to one, and so we need a 1 in
the numerator. x

x = 1 . This leads to the Quotient Property for Exponents.

We see am

am simplifies to a0 and to 1. So a0 = 1. Any non-zero base raised to the power of zero equals 1.

Zero Exponent Property

If a is a non-zero number, then a0 = 1.
If a is a non-zero number, then a to the power of zero equals 1.

Any non-zero number raised to the zero power is 1.

In this text, we assume any variable that we raise to the zero power is not zero.

Use the Definition of a Negative Exponent

We saw that the Quotient Property for Exponents has two forms depending on whether the exponent is larger in the
numerator or the denominator. What if we just subtract exponents regardless of which is larger?
Let’s consider x2

x5. We subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator. We see x2
x5

is

x2 − 5 or x−3.
We can also simplify x2
x5

by dividing out common factors:

Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions

This implies that x−3 = 1

and it leads us to the definition of a negative exponent. If n is an integer and a ≠ 0,

then

Let’s now look at what happens to a fraction whose numerator is one and whose denominator is an integer raised to a
negative exponent.

Use the definition of a negative exponent, a−n = 1
an.

Simplify the complex fraction.

a−n = an and is another form of the definition of Properties of Negative Exponents.

Properties of Negative Exponents

If n is an integer and a ≠ 0,

then a−n = 1

an or 1

a−n = an.

The negative exponent tells us we can rewrite the expression by taking the reciprocal of the base and then changing the
sign of the exponent.

Any expression that has negative exponents is not considered to be in simplest form. We will use the definition of a
negative exponent and other properties of exponents to write the expression with only positive exponents.
For example, if after simplifying an expression we end up with the expression x−3, we will take one more step and write
1
x3. The answer is considered to be in simplest form when it has only positive exponents.

Use Scientific Notation

Working with very large or very small numbers can be awkward. Since our number system is base ten we can use powers
of ten to rewrite very large or very small numbers to make them easier to work with. Consider the numbers 4,000 and
0.004.

Using place value, we can rewrite the numbers 4,000 and 0.004. We know that 4,000 means 4 × 1,000 and 0.004 means
4 × 1

.

1,000

If we write the 1,000 as a power of ten in exponential form, we can rewrite these numbers in this way:

4,000

4 × 1,000

0.004

4 × 1

1,000

4 × 103

4 × 1
103

4 × 10−3

When a number is written as a product of two numbers, where the first factor is a number greater than or equal to one
but less than ten, and the second factor is a power of 10 written in exponential form, it is said to be in scientific notation.

Scientific Notation

A number is expressed in scientific notation when it is of the form

a × 10n where 1 ≤ a < 10 and n is an integer.

It is customary in scientific notation to use as the × multiplication sign, even though we avoid using this sign elsewhere
in algebra.

If we look at what happened to the decimal point, we can see a method to easily convert from decimal notation to

516

Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions

scientific notation.

In both cases, the decimal was moved 3 places to get the first factor between 1 and 10.
The power of 10 is positive when the number is larger than 1: 4,000 = 4 × 103

The power of 10 is negative when the number is between 0 and 1: 0.004 = 4 × 10−3

HOW TO : : TO CONVERT A DECIMAL TO SCIENTIFIC NOTATION.

Step 1.

Move the decimal point so that the first factor is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10.

Step 2.

Count the number of decimal places, n, that the decimal point was moved.

Step 3.

Write the number as a product with a power of 10. If the original number is.

◦ greater than 1, the power of 10 will be 10n.
◦ between 0 and 1, the power of 10 will be 10−n.

Step 4.

Check.

EXAMPLE 5.22

Write in scientific notation: ⓐ 37,000 ⓑ 0.0052.

Solution

ⓐ

The original number, 37,000, is greater than 1
so we will have a positive power of 10.

If we look at the location of the decimal point, we can see an easy method to convert a number from scientific notation to
decimal form.

In both cases the decimal point moved 4 places. When the exponent was positive, the decimal moved to the right. When
the exponent was negative, the decimal point moved to the left.

HOW TO : : CONVERT SCIENTIFIC NOTATION TO DECIMAL FORM.

Step 1.

Determine the exponent, n, on the factor 10.

Step 2.

Move the decimal n places, adding zeros if needed.

Multiply a Binomial by a Binomial

Just like there are different ways to represent multiplication of numbers, there are several methods that can be used to
multiply a binomial times a binomial. We will start by using the Distributive Property.

⎝y + 5⎞

⎠

⎝y + 8⎞

⎠ ⓑ ⎛

⎝4y + 3⎞

If you multiply binomials often enough you may notice a pattern. Notice that the first term in the result is the product of
the first terms in each binomial. The second and third terms are the product of multiplying the two outer terms and then
the two inner terms. And the last term results from multiplying the two last terms,

We abbreviate “First, Outer, Inner, Last” as FOIL. The letters stand for ‘First, Outer, Inner, Last’. We use this as another
method of multiplying binomials. The word FOIL is easy to remember and ensures we find all four products.

Let’s multiply (x + 3)(x + 7) using both methods.

We summarize the steps of the FOIL method below. The FOIL method only applies to multiplying binomials, not other
polynomials!

HOW TO : : USE THE FOIL METHOD TO MULTIPLY TWO BINOMIALS.

When you multiply by the FOIL method, drawing the lines will help your brain focus on the pattern and make it easier to
apply.

Now we will do an example where we use the FOIL pattern to multiply two binomials.

⎝y − 7⎞

⎛

The FOIL method is usually the quickest method for multiplying two binomials, but it only works for binomials. You can
use the Distributive Property to find the product of any two polynomials. Another method that works for all polynomials
is the Vertical Method. It is very much like the method you use to multiply whole numbers. Look carefully at this example
of multiplying two-digit numbers.

Now we’ll apply this same method to multiply two binomials.

We have now used three methods for multiplying binomials. Be sure to practice each method, and try to decide which one
you prefer. The methods are listed here all together, to help you remember them.

Multiplying Two Binomials

To multiply binomials, use the:

• Distributive Property

• FOIL Method

• Vertical Method

Multiply a Polynomial by a Polynomial

We have multiplied monomials by monomials, monomials by polynomials, and binomials by binomials. Now we’re ready
to multiply a polynomial by a polynomial. Remember, FOIL will not work in this case, but we can use either the Distributive
Property or the Vertical Method.

EXAMPLE 5.31

Multiply (b + 3)(2b2 − 5b + 8) using ⓐ the Distributive Property and ⓑ the Vertical Method.

Solution

ⓐ

Distribute.

Multiply.

Combine like terms.

ⓑ It is easier to put the polynomial with fewer terms on the bottom because we get fewer partial products this way.

We have now seen two methods you can use to multiply a polynomial by a polynomial. After you practice each method,
you’ll probably find you prefer one way over the other. We list both methods are listed here, for easy reference.

Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial

To multiply a trinomial by a binomial, use the:

• Distributive Property

• Vertical Method

Multiply Special Products

Mathematicians like to look for patterns that will make their work easier. A good example of this is squaring binomials.
While you can always get the product by writing the binomial twice and multiplying them, there is less work to do if you
learn to use a pattern. Let’s start by looking at three examples and look for a pattern.

Look at these results. Do you see any patterns?

What about the number of terms? In each example we squared a binomial and the result was a trinomial.

(a + b)2 = ___ + ___ + ___

Now look at the first term in each result. Where did it come from?

The first term is the product of the first terms of each binomial. Since the binomials are identical, it is just the square of
the first term!

To get the first term of the product, square the first term.

(a + b)2 = a2 + ___ + ___

Where did the last term come from? Look at the examples and find the pattern.

The last term is the product of the last terms, which is the square of the last term.

To get the last term of the product, square the last term.

(a + b)2 = ___ + ___ + b2

Finally, look at the middle term. Notice it came from adding the “outer” and the “inner” terms—which are both the same!
So the middle term is double the product of the two terms of the binomial.

Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions

531

To get the middle term of the product, multiply the terms and double their product.

(a + b)2 = ___ + 2ab + ___
(a − b)2 = ___ − 2ab + ___

Putting it all together:

Binomial Squares Pattern

If a and b are real numbers,

To square a binomial, square the first term, square the last term , double their product.

EXAMPLE 5.32

Multiply: ⓐ (x + 5)2 ⓑ ⎛

⎝2x − 3y⎞

⎠

Solution

ⓐ

Square the first term.

Square the last term.

Double their product.

ⓑ

TRY IT : : 5.64

⎠

We just saw a pattern for squaring binomials that we can use to make multiplying some binomials easier. Similarly, there
is a pattern for another product of binomials. But before we get to it, we need to introduce some vocabulary.

532

Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions

A pair of binomials that each have the same first term and the same last term, but one is a sum and one is a difference is
called a conjugate pair and is of the form (a − b), (a + b).

Conjugate Pair

A conjugate pair is two binomials of the form

(a − b), (a + b).

The pair of binomials each have the same first term and the same last term, but one binomial is a sum and the other
is a difference.

There is a nice pattern for finding the product of conjugates. You could, of course, simply FOIL to get the product, but
using the pattern makes your work easier. Let’s look for the pattern by using FOIL to multiply some conjugate pairs.

What do you observe about the products?

The product of the two binomials is also a binomial! Most of the products resulting from FOIL have been trinomials.

Each first term is the product of the first terms of the binomials, and since they are identical it is the square of the first
term.

(a + b)(a − b) = a2 − ___

To get the first term, square the first term.

The last term came from multiplying the last terms, the square of the last term.

(a + b)(a − b) = a2 − b2

To get the last term, square the last term.

Why is there no middle term? Notice the two middle terms you get from FOIL combine to 0 in every case, the result of one
addition and one subtraction.

The product of conjugates is always of the form a2 − b2. This is called a difference of squares.
This leads to the pattern:

Product of Conjugates Pattern

If a and b are real numbers,

The product is called a difference of squares.

To multiply conjugates, square the first term, square the last term, write it as a difference of squares.

EXAMPLE 5.33

Multiply using the product of conjugates pattern: ⓐ (2x + 5)(2x − 5) ⓑ (5m − 9n)(5m + 9n).

Solution

533

Are the binomials conjugates?

It is the product of conjugates.

Square the first term, 2x.

Square the last term, 5.

Simplify. The product is a difference of squares.

ⓑ

This fits the pattern.

Use the pattern.

⎠.

Multiply: ⓐ (2x + 7)(2x − 7) ⓑ ⎛

⎝3x − y⎞

⎛
⎠

⎝3x + y⎞
⎠.

We just developed special product patterns for Binomial Squares and for the Product of Conjugates. The products look
similar, so it is important to recognize when it is appropriate to use each of these patterns and to notice how they differ.
Look at the two patterns together and note their similarities and differences.

Comparing the Special Product Patterns

Binomial Squares

(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2

(a − b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2

Product of Conjugates

Divide a Polynomial by a Monomial

Now that we know how to divide a monomial by a monomial, the next procedure is to divide a polynomial of two or more
terms by a monomial.

The method we’ll use to divide a polynomial by a monomial is based on the properties of fraction addition. So we’ll start
with an example to review fraction addition. The sum y

simplifies to y + 2

.

Now we will do this in reverse to split a single fraction into separate fractions. For example, y + 2

This is the “reverse” of fraction addition and it states that if a, b, and c are numbers where c ≠ 0,
We will use this to divide polynomials by monomials.

Divide Polynomials Using Long Division

Divide a polynomial by a binomial, we follow a procedure very similar to long division of numbers. So let’s look carefully
the steps we take when we divide a 3-digit number, 875, by a 2-digit number, 25.

We check division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor.

If we did the division correctly, the product should equal the dividend.

Now we will divide a trinomial by a binomial. As you read through the example, notice how similar the steps are to the
numerical example above.

EXAMPLE 5.39

⎝x2 + 9x + 20

⎠ ÷ (x + 5).

You may find it easier to change the signs and then add.
Then bring down the last term, 20.

When we divided 875 by 25, we had no remainder. But sometimes division of numbers does leave a remainder. The same
is true when we divide polynomials. In the next example, we’ll have a division that leaves a remainder. We write the
remainder as a fraction with the divisor as the denominator.

Look back at the dividends in previous examples. The terms were written in descending order of degrees, and there were
no missing degrees. The dividend in this example will be x4 − x2 + 5x − 6. It is missing an x3 term. We will add in 0x3
as a placeholder.

Divide Polynomials using Synthetic Division

As we have mentioned before, mathematicians like to find patterns to make their work easier. Since long division can be
tedious, let’s look back at the long division we did in Example 5.39 and look for some patterns. We will use this as a basis

for what is called synthetic division. The same problem in the synthetic division format is shown next.

Synthetic division basically just removes unnecessary repeated variables and numbers. Here all the x and x2 are
removed. as well as the −x2 and −4x as they are opposite the term above.
The first row of the synthetic division is the coefficients of the dividend. The −5 is the opposite of the 5 in the divisor.

The second row of the synthetic division are the numbers shown in red in the division problem.

The third row of the synthetic division are the numbers shown in blue in the division problem.

Notice the quotient and remainder are shown in the third row.

Synthetic division only works when the divisor is of the form x − c.

The following example will explain the process.

EXAMPLE 5.42

Use synthetic division to find the quotient and remainder when 2x3 + 3x2 + x + 8 is divided by x + 2.

Solution

Write the dividend with decreasing powers of x.

Write the coefficients of the terms as the first
row of the synthetic division.

Write the divisor as x − c and place c
in the synthetic division in the divisor box.

Bring down the first coefficient to the third row.

Multiply that coefficient by the divisor and place the
result in the second row under the second coefficient.

Add the second column, putting the result in the third row.

Multiply that result by the divisor and place the
result in the second row under the third coefficient.

Add the third column, putting the result in the third row.

Multiply that result by the divisor and place the

The division is complete. The numbers in the third row give us the result. The 2 −1 3 are the coefficients of the
quotient. The quotient is 2x2 − 1x + 3. The 2 in the box in the third row is the remainder.

Use the Remainder and Factor Theorem

Let’s look at the division problems we have just worked that ended up with a remainder. They are summarized in the chart
below. If we take the dividend from each division problem and use it to define a function, we get the functions shown in
the chart. When the divisor is written as x − c,
is the same as the remainder from
the division problem.

To see this more generally, we realize we can check a division problem by multiplying the quotient times the divisor and
add the remainder. In function notation we could say, to get the dividend f (x), we multiply the quotient, q(x) times
the divisor, x − c, and add the remainder, r.

If we evaluate this at c, we get:

This leads us to the Remainder Theorem.

Remainder Theorem

If the polynomial function f (x) is divided by x − c,

then the remainder is f (c).

EXAMPLE 5.45

Use the Remainder Theorem to find the remainder when f (x) = x3 + 3x + 19 is divided by x + 2.

Solution

To use the Remainder Theorem, we must use the divisor in the x − c form. We can write the divisor x + 2 as x − (−2).
So, our c is −2.

To find the remainder, we evaluate f (c) which is f (−2).

When we divided 8a3 + 27 by 2a + 3 in Example 5.41 the result was 4a2 − 6a + 9. To check our work, we multiply
4a2 − 6a + 9 by 2a + 3 to get 8a3 + 27 .
⎛
⎝4a2 − 6a + 9

⎞
⎠(2a + 3) = 8a3 + 27

Written this way, we can see that 4a2 − 6a + 9 and 2a + 3 are factors of 8a3 + 27. When we did the division, the
remainder was zero.

Whenever a divisor, x − c, divides a polynomial function,

Subtract.

f (x) = x3 − 64
f (4) = 43 − 64

KEY TERMS

binomial

A binomial is a polynomial with exactly two terms.

conjugate pair

A conjugate pair is two binomials of the form (a − b), (a + b). The pair of binomials each have the

same first term and the same last term, but one binomial is a sum and the other is a difference.

degree of a constant

The degree of any constant is 0.

degree of a polynomial

The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of all its terms.

degree of a term

The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of its variables.

monomial

A monomial is an algebraic expression with one term. A monomial in one variable is a term of the form

axm, where a is a constant and m is a whole number.

polynomial

A monomial or two or more monomials combined by addition or subtraction is a polynomial.

polynomial function

Introduction

An epidemic of a disease has broken out. Where did it start? How is it spreading? What can be done to control it? Answers
to these and other questions can be found by scientists known as epidemiologists. They collect data and analyze it to study
disease and consider possible control measures. Because diseases can spread at alarming rates, these scientists must use
their knowledge of mathematics involving factoring. In this chapter, you will learn how to factor and apply factoring to
real-life situations.

6.1 Greatest Common Factor and Factor by Grouping

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Factor 56 into primes.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.2.

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 24.

Find the Greatest Common Factor of Two or More Expressions

Earlier we multiplied factors together to get a product. Now, we will reverse this process; we will start with a product and
then break it down into its factors. Splitting a product into factors is called factoring.

566

Chapter 6 Factoring

We have learned how to factor numbers to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers. Now we will
factor expressions and find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions. The method we use is similar to
what we used to find the LCM.

Greatest Common Factor

The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more expressions is the largest expression that is a factor of all the
expressions.

We summarize the steps we use to find the greatest common factor.

HOW TO : : FIND THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR (GCF) OF TWO EXPRESSIONS.

Step 1.

Factor each coefficient into primes. Write all variables with exponents in expanded form.

Step 2.

List all factors—matching common factors in a column. In each column, circle the common
factors.

Step 3.

Bring down the common factors that all expressions share.

Step 4.

Multiply the factors.

The next example will show us the steps to find the greatest common factor of three expressions.

EXAMPLE 6.1

Find the greatest common factor of 21x3, 9x2, 15x.

Solution

Factor each coefficient into primes and write the
variables with exponents in expanded form.
Circle the common factors in each column.
Bring down the common factors.

Multiply the factors.

The GCF of 21x3 , 9x2 and 15x is 3x .

Factor the Greatest Common Factor from a Polynomial

It is sometimes useful to represent a number as a product of factors, for example, 12 as 2 · 6 or 3 · 4. In algebra, it can
also be useful to represent a polynomial in factored form. We will start with a product, such as 3x2 + 15x, and end with

its factors, 3x(x + 5). To do this we apply the Distributive Property “in reverse.”

We state the Distributive Property here just as you saw it in earlier chapters and “in reverse.”

Distributive Property

If a, b, and c are real numbers, then

The form on the left is used to multiply. The form on the right is used to factor.

a(b + c) = ab + ac

and ab + ac = a(b + c)

So how do you use the Distributive Property to factor a polynomial? You just find the GCF of all the terms and write the
polynomial as a product!

EXAMPLE 6.2 HOW TO USE THE DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY TO FACTOR A POLYNOMIAL

Factor: 8m3 − 12m2 n + 20mn2.

Solution

TRY IT : : 6.3

Factor: 9xy2 + 6x2 y2 + 21y3.

TRY IT : : 6.4

Factor: 3p3 − 6p2 q + 9pq3.

HOW TO : : FACTOR THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR FROM A POLYNOMIAL.

Step 1.

Find the GCF of all the terms of the polynomial.

Step 2.

Rewrite each term as a product using the GCF.

Step 3.

Use the “reverse” Distributive Property to factor the expression.

Step 4.

Check by multiplying the factors.

Factor by Grouping

Sometimes there is no common factor of all the terms of a polynomial. When there are four terms we separate the
polynomial into two parts with two terms in each part. Then look for the GCF in each part. If the polynomial can be
factored, you will find a common factor emerges from both parts. Not all polynomials can be factored. Just like some
numbers are prime, some polynomials are prime.

Factor trinomials of the form x2 + bx + c
Factor trinomials of the form ax2 + bx + c using trial and error
Factor trinomials of the form ax2 + bx + c using the ‘ac’ method

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Find all the factors of 72.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.2.

2. Find the product: (3y + 4)(2y + 5).

Factor Trinomials of the Form x2 + bx + c

You have already learned how to multiply binomials using FOIL. Now you’ll need to “undo” this multiplication. To factor
the trinomial means to start with the product, and end with the factors.

To figure out how we would factor a trinomial of the form x2 + bx + c,
(x + 2)(x + 3),

let’s start with two general binomials of the form (x + m) and (x + n).

such as x2 + 5x + 6 and factor it to

Foil to find the product.

Factor the GCF from the middle terms.

Our trinomial is of the form x2 + bx + c.

This tells us that to factor a trinomial of the form x2 + bx + c, we need two factors (x + m) and (x + n) where the two
numbers m and n multiply to c and add to b.

Step 2.

Find two numbers m and n that

◦ multiply to c, m · n = c

◦ add to b, m + n = b

Step 3.

Use m and n as the last terms of the factors.

(x + m)(x + n)

Step 4.

Check by multiplying the factors.

In the first example, all terms in the trinomial were positive. What happens when there are negative terms? Well, it
depends which term is negative. Let’s look first at trinomials with only the middle term negative.

How do you get a positive product and a negative sum? We use two negative numbers.

EXAMPLE 6.10

Factor: y2 − 11y + 28.

576

Solution

Chapter 6 Factoring

Again, with the positive last term, 28, and the negative middle term, −11y, we need two negative factors. Find two

Factor: u2 − 9u + 18.

TRY IT : : 6.20

Factor: y2 − 16y + 63.

Now, what if the last term in the trinomial is negative? Think about FOIL. The last term is the product of the last terms
in the two binomials. A negative product results from multiplying two numbers with opposite signs. You have to be very
careful to choose factors to make sure you get the correct sign for the middle term, too.

How do you get a negative product and a positive sum? We use one positive and one negative number.

When we factor trinomials, we must have the terms written in descending order—in order from highest degree to lowest
degree.

Some trinomials are prime. The only way to be certain a trinomial is prime is to list all the possibilities and show that none

Solution

We need u in the first term of each binomial and v in the second term. The last term of the trinomial is negative, so the
factors must have opposite signs.

Strategy for Factoring Trinomials of the Form x2 + bx + c

When we factor a trinomial, we look at the signs of its terms first to determine the signs of the binomial factors.

x2 + bx + c
(x + m)(x + n)
When c is positive, m and n have the same sign.

b positive
m, n positive
x2 + 5x + 6
(x + 2)(x + 3)
same signs

b negative
m, n negative
x2 − 6x + 8
(x − 4)(x − 2)
same signs

When c is negative, m and n have opposite signs.

x2 + x − 12
(x + 4)(x − 3)
opposite signs

x2 − 2x − 15
(x − 5)(x + 3)
opposite signs

Notice that, in the case when m and n have opposite signs, the sign of the one with the larger absolute value matches
the sign of b.

Factor Trinomials of the form ax2 + bx + c using Trial and Error
Our next step is to factor trinomials whose leading coefficient is not 1, trinomials of the form ax2 + bx + c.
Remember to always check for a GCF first! Sometimes, after you factor the GCF, the leading coefficient of the trinomial
becomes 1 and you can factor it by the methods we’ve used so far. Let’s do an example to see how this works.

EXAMPLE 6.14

Factor completely: 4x3 + 16x2 − 20x.

Solution

Is there a greatest common factor?

Yes, GCF = 4x. Factor it.

4x3 + 16x2 − 20x
⎛
⎝x2 + 4x − 5

⎞
⎠

Binomial, trinomial, or more than three terms?

It is a trinomial. So “undo FOIL.”

Factor completely: 6y3 + 18y2 − 60y.

What happens when the leading coefficient is not 1 and there is no GCF? There are several methods that can be used to
factor these trinomials. First we will use the Trial and Error method.

Let’s factor the trinomial 3x2 + 5x + 2.
From our earlier work, we expect this will factor into two binomials.

We know the first terms of the binomial factors will multiply to give us 3x2. The only factors of 3x2 are 1x, 3x. We can
place them in the binomials.

3x2 + 5x + 2
)
)(
(

Check: Does 1x · 3x = 3x2 ?
We know the last terms of the binomials will multiply to 2. Since this trinomial has all positive terms, we only need to
consider positive factors. The only factors of 2 are 1, 2. But we now have two cases to consider as it will make a difference
if we write 1, 2 or 2, 1.

Which factors are correct? To decide that, we multiply the inner and outer terms.

Since the middle term of the trinomial is 5x,

the factors in the first case will work. Let’s use FOIL to check.

Our result of the factoring is:

(x + 1)(3x + 2)
3x2 + 2x + 3x + 2
3x2 + 5x + 2 ✓

3x2 + 5x + 2
(x + 1)(3x + 2)

Factor Using Substitution
Sometimes a trinomial does not appear to be in the ax2 + bx + c form. However, we can often make a thoughtful
substitution that will allow us to make it fit the ax2 + bx + c form. This is called factoring by substitution. It is standard
to use u for the substitution.

In the ax2 + bx + c,
this relationship as you try to find a substitution.

the middle term has a variable, x, and its square, x2,

is the variable part of the first term. Look for

EXAMPLE 6.21

Factor by substitution: x4 − 4x2 − 5.

Solution

The variable part of the middle term is x2 and its square, x4,

is the variable part of the first term. (We know

2

⎝x2⎞
⎛
⎠

= x4). If we let u = x2, we can put our trinomial in the ax2 + bx + c form we need to factor it.

Sometimes the expression to be substituted is not a monomial.

EXAMPLE 6.22

Factor by substitution: (x − 2)2 + 7(x − 2) + 12

Solution

The binomial in the middle term, (x − 2) is squared in the first term. If we let u = x − 2 and substitute, our trinomial
will be in ax2 + bx + c form.

Rewrite the trinomial to prepare for the substitution.

Let u = x − 2 and substitute.

Factor the trinomial.

Replace u with x − 2.

Simplify inside the parentheses.

This could also be factored by first multiplying out the (x − 2)2 and the 7(x − 2) and then combining like terms and
then factoring. Most students prefer the substitution method.

We have seen that some binomials and trinomials result from special products—squaring binomials and multiplying
conjugates. If you learn to recognize these kinds of polynomials, you can use the special products patterns to factor them
much more quickly.

Factor Perfect Square Trinomials

Some trinomials are perfect squares. They result from multiplying a binomial times itself. We squared a binomial using
the Binomial Squares pattern in a previous chapter.

The trinomial 9x2 + 24x + 16 is called a perfect square trinomial. It is the square of the binomial 3x + 4.
In this chapter, you will start with a perfect square trinomial and factor it into its prime factors.

You could factor this trinomial using the methods described in the last section, since it is of the form ax2 + bx + c. But
if you recognize that the first and last terms are squares and the trinomial fits the perfect square trinomials pattern, you
will save yourself a lot of work.

Here is the pattern—the reverse of the binomial squares pattern.

Perfect Square Trinomials Pattern

If a and b are real numbers

a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2
a2 − 2ab + b2 = (a − b)2

To make use of this pattern, you have to recognize that a given trinomial fits it. Check first to see if the leading coefficient
is a perfect square, a2. Next check that the last term is a perfect square, b2. Then check the middle term—is it the
product, 2ab ? If everything checks, you can easily write the factors.

The first and last terms are squares. See if the middle term fits the pattern of a perfect square trinomial. The middle term
is negative, so the binomial square would be (a − b)2.

Are the first and last terms perfect squares?

Check the middle term.

Does it match (a − b)2 ? Yes.

Write as the square of a binomial.

Remember the first step in factoring is to look for a greatest common factor. Perfect square trinomials may have a GCF in
all three terms and it should be factored out first. And, sometimes, once the GCF has been factored, you will recognize a
perfect square trinomial.

EXAMPLE 6.26

Factor Differences of Squares

The other special product you saw in the previous chapter was the Product of Conjugates pattern. You used this to
multiply two binomials that were conjugates. Here’s an example:

A difference of squares factors to a product of conjugates.

Difference of Squares Pattern

If a and b are real numbers,

596

Chapter 6 Factoring

Remember, “difference” refers to subtraction. So, to use this pattern you must make sure you have a binomial in which
two squares are being subtracted.

Factor: 64y2 − 1.

Solution

TRY IT : : 6.53

Factor: 121m2 − 1.

TRY IT : : 6.54

HOW TO : : FACTOR DIFFERENCES OF SQUARES.

Step 1. Does the binomial fit the pattern?

Is this a difference?
Are the first and last terms perfect squares?

Step 2. Write them as squares.
Step 3. Write the product of conjugates.
Step 4. Check by multiplying.

a2 − b2
____ − ____

(a)2 − (b)2
(a − b)(a + b)

It is important to remember that sums of squares do not factor into a product of binomials. There are no binomial factors
that multiply together to get a sum of squares. After removing any GCF, the expression a2 + b2 is prime!
The next example shows variables in both terms.

As always, you should look for a common factor first whenever you have an expression to factor. Sometimes a common
factor may “disguise” the difference of squares and you won’t recognize the perfect squares until you factor the GCF.

Also, to completely factor the binomial in the next example, we’ll factor a difference of squares twice!

EXAMPLE 6.29

Factor: 48x4 y2 − 243y2.

Solution

Is there a GCF? Yes, 3y2 —factor it out!

from there. Here we will notice that the first three terms form a perfect square trinomial.

Factor Sums and Differences of Cubes

There is another special pattern for factoring, one that we did not use when we multiplied polynomials. This is the pattern
for the sum and difference of cubes. We will write these formulas first and then check them by multiplication.
⎝a2 − ab + b2⎞
⎛
a3 + b3 = (a + b)

⎛
a3 − b3 = (a − b)

The two patterns look very similar, don’t they? But notice the signs in the factors. The sign of the binomial factor matches
the sign in the original binomial. And the sign of the middle term of the trinomial factor is the opposite of the sign in the
original binomial. If you recognize the pattern of the signs, it may help you memorize the patterns.

The trinomial factor in the sum and difference of cubes pattern cannot be factored.

It be very helpful if you learn to recognize the cubes of the integers from 1 to 10, just like you have learned to recognize
squares. We have listed the cubes of the integers from 1 to 10 in Table 6.1.

Factor it out.

Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
If it is a binomial:

◦

◦

Is it a sum?
Of squares? Sums of squares do not factor.
Of cubes? Use the sum of cubes pattern.

Is it a difference?
Of squares? Factor as the product of conjugates.
Of cubes? Use the difference of cubes pattern.

If it is a trinomial:

◦

◦

Is it of the form x2 + bx + c ? Undo FOIL.

Is it of the form ax2 + bx + c ?
If a and c are squares, check if it fits the trinomial square pattern.
Use the trial and error or “ac” method.

If it has more than three terms:

◦ Use the grouping method.

Step 3.

Check.
Is it factored completely?
Do the factors multiply back to the original polynomial?

Remember, a polynomial is completely factored if, other than monomials, its factors are prime!

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Solve: 5y − 3 = 0.

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.2.

2. Factor completely: n3 − 9n2 − 22n.

If you missed this problem, review Example 3.48.

If you missed this problem, review Example 3.59.

find f (3) and solve f (x) = 0.

We have spent considerable time learning how to factor polynomials. We will now look at polynomial equations and solve
them using factoring, if possible.

A polynomial equation is an equation that contains a polynomial expression. The degree of the polynomial equation
is the degree of the polynomial.

Polynomial Equation

A polynomial equation is an equation that contains a polynomial expression.

The degree of the polynomial equation is the degree of the polynomial.

We have already solved polynomial equations of degree one. Polynomial equations of degree one are linear equations
are of the form ax + b = c.

We are now going to solve polynomial equations of degree two. A polynomial equation of degree two is called a quadratic
equation. Listed below are some examples of quadratic equations:

x2 + 5x + 6 = 0

3y2 + 4y = 10

64u2 − 81 = 0

n(n + 1) = 42

The last equation doesn’t appear to have the variable squared, but when we simplify the expression on the left we will get
n2 + n.

The general form of a quadratic equation is ax2 + bx + c = 0, with a ≠ 0. (If a = 0,
with no quadratic term.)

then 0 · x2 = 0 and we are left

Quadratic Equation

An equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is called a quadratic equation.

a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0

To solve quadratic equations we need methods different from the ones we used in solving linear equations. We will look
at one method here and then several others in a later chapter.

Use the Zero Product Property

We will first solve some quadratic equations by using the Zero Product Property. The Zero Product Property says that if
the product of two quantities is zero, then at least one of the quantities is zero. The only way to get a product equal to
zero is to multiply by zero itself.

616

Chapter 6 Factoring

Zero Product Property

If a · b = 0,

then either a = 0 or b = 0 or both.

We will now use the Zero Product Property, to solve a quadratic equation.

Solve Quadratic Equations by Factoring

The Zero Product Property works very nicely to solve quadratic equations. The quadratic equation must be factored, with
zero isolated on one side. So we be sure to start with the quadratic equation in standard form, ax2 + bx + c = 0. Then
we factor the expression on the left.

Chapter 6 Factoring

Before we factor, we must make sure the quadratic equation is in standard form.

Solving quadratic equations by factoring will make use of all the factoring techniques you have learned in this chapter!
Do you recognize the special product pattern in the next example?

EXAMPLE 6.46

Solve: 169q2 = 49.

13x − 7 = 0

TRY IT : : 6.92

Solve: 36x2 = 121.

In the next example, the left side of the equation is factored, but the right side is not zero. In order to use the Zero Product
Property, one side of the equation must be zero. We’ll multiply the factors and then write the equation in standard form.

EXAMPLE 6.47

Solve: (3x − 8)(x − 1) = 3x.

Multiply the binomials.

Write the quadratic equation in standard form.

The Zero Product Property also applies to the product of three or more factors. If the product is zero, at least one of the
factors must be zero. We can solve some equations of degree greater than two by using the Zero Product Property, just
like we solved quadratic equations.

value or what points lie on the graph of the function. Our work with the Zero Product Property will be help us find these
answers.

a zero of the function.

EXAMPLE 6.54

A boat’s sail is in the shape of a right triangle as shown. The hypotenuse will be 17 feet long. The length of one side will
be 7 feet less than the length of the other side. Find the lengths of the sides of the sail.

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem

Step 2. Identify what you are looking for.

Step 3. Name what you are looking for.
One side is 7 less than the other.

Step 4. Translate into an equation. Since this is a
right triangle we can use the Pythagorean Theorem.

Substitute in the variables.

Step 5. Solve the equation
Simplify.

It is a quadratic equation, so get zero on one side.

Factor the greatest common factor.

Factor the trinomial.

We are looking for the lengths of the
sides of the sail.

Let x = length of a side of the sail.
x − 7 = length of other side

a2 + b2 = c2

x2 + (x − 7)2 = 172

x2 + x2 − 14x + 49 = 289

2x2 − 14x + 49 = 289

2x2 − 14x − 240 = 0

2(x2 − 7x − 120) = 0

2(x − 15)(x + 8) = 0

Use the Zero Product Property.

2 ≠ 0

x − 15 = 0 x + 8 = 0

Solve.

Since x is a side of the triangle, x = −8 does not
make sense.

Find the length of the other side.

2 ≠ 0

x = 15

x = −8

2 ≠ 0

x = 15

x = −8

The next example uses the function that gives the height of an object as a function of time when it is thrown from 80 feet
above the ground.

EXAMPLE 6.55

Dennis is going to throw his rubber band ball upward from the top of a campus building. When he throws the rubber
band ball from 80 feet above the ground, the function h(t) = −16t 2 + 64t + 80 models the height, h, of the ball above
the ground as a function of time, t. Find:

ⓐ the zeros of this function which tell us when the ball hits the ground
ⓑ when the ball will be 80 feet above the ground
ⓒ the height of the ball at t = 2 seconds.

Solution

ⓐ The zeros of this function are found by solving h(t) = 0. This will tell us when the ball will hit the ground.

Substitute in the polynomial for h(t).

Factor the GCF, −16.
Factor the trinomial.
Use the Zero Product Property.
Solve.

h(t) = 0
−16t 2 + 64t + 80 = 0
−16(t 2 − 4t − 5) = 0
−16(t − 5)(t + 1) = 0

t − 5 = 0
t = 5

t + 1 = 0

t = −1

The result t = 5 tells us the ball will hit the ground 5 seconds after it is thrown. Since time cannot be negative, the result

Chapter 6 Factoring

626

t = −1 is discarded.

ⓑ The ball will be 80 feet above the ground when h(t) = 80.

Substitute in the polynomial for h(t).

Subtract 80 from both sides.
Factor the GCF, −16t.
Use the Zero Product Property.
Solve.

h(t) = 80
−16t 2 + 64t + 80 = 80
−16t 2 + 64t = 0
−16t(t − 4) = 0

−16t = 0
t = 0

t − 4 = 0
t = 4

The ball will be at 80 feet the moment Dennis
tosses the ball and then 4 seconds later, when
the ball is falling.

ⓒ To find the height ball at t = 2 seconds we find h(2).

To find h(2) substitute 2 for t.
Simplify.

TRY IT : : 6.109

h(t) = −16t 2 + 64t + 80
h(2) = −16(2)2 + 64 · 2 + 80
h(2) = 144
After 2 seconds, the ball will be at 144 feet.

Genevieve is going to throw a rock from the top a trail overlooking the ocean. When she throws the rock upward

the ocean as a function of time, t. Find:

ⓐ the zeros of this function which tell us when the rock will hit the ocean
ⓑ when the rock will be 160 feet above the ocean.

ocean as a function of time, t. Find:

ⓐ the zeros of this function which is when the penny will hit the ocean
ⓑ when the penny will be 128 feet above the ocean.

Introduction

Twelve goals last season. Fifteen home runs. Nine touchdowns. Whatever the statistics, sports analysts know it. Their jobs
depend on it. Compiling and analyzing sports data not only help fans appreciate their teams but also help owners and
coaches decide which players to recruit, how to best use them in games, how much they should be paid, and which players
to trade. Understanding this kind of data requires a knowledge of specific types of expressions and functions. In this
chapter, you will work with rational expressions and perform operations on them. And you will use rational expressions
and inequalities to solve real-world problems.

7.1 Multiply and Divide Rational Expressions

We previously reviewed the properties of fractions and their operations. We introduced rational numbers, which are
just fractions where the numerators and denominators are integers. In this chapter, we will work with fractions whose
numerators and denominators are polynomials. We call this kind of expression a rational expression.

Rational Expression

A rational expression is an expression of the form p

q , where p and q are polynomials and q ≠ 0.

Here are some examples of rational expressions:

− 24
56

5x
12y

4x + 1
x2 − 9

4x2 + 3x − 1
2x − 8

Notice that the first rational expression listed above, − 24
56

, is just a fraction. Since a constant is a polynomial with degree

zero, the ratio of two constants is a rational expression, provided the denominator is not zero.

We will do the same operations with rational expressions that we did with fractions. We will simplify, add, subtract,
multiply, divide and use them in applications.

Determine the Values for Which a Rational Expression is Undefined

If the denominator is zero, the rational expression is undefined. The numerator of a rational expression may be 0—but
not the denominator.

When we work with a numerical fraction, it is easy to avoid dividing by zero because we can see the number in the
denominator. In order to avoid dividing by zero in a rational expression, we must not allow values of the variable that will
make the denominator be zero.

So before we begin any operation with a rational expression, we examine it first to find the values that would make the
denominator zero. That way, when we solve a rational equation for example, we will know whether the algebraic solutions
we find are allowed or not.

HOW TO : : DETERMINE THE VALUES FOR WHICH A RATIONAL EXPRESSION IS UNDEFINED.

Step 1.

Set the denominator equal to zero.

Step 2.

Solve the equation.

Simplify Rational Expressions

A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator.
Similarly, a simplified rational expression has no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator.

Simplified Rational Expression

A rational expression is considered simplified if there are no common factors in its numerator and denominator.

For example,

x + 2
x + 3
2x
3x

is simplified because there are no common factors of x + 2 and x + 3.

is not simplified because x is a common factor of 2x and 3x.

We use the Equivalent Fractions Property to simplify numerical fractions. We restate it here as we will also use it to simplify
rational expressions.

Equivalent Fractions Property

If a, b, and c are numbers where b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0,

642

Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions

then a
b

= a · c
b · c

and

a · c
b · c

= a
b

.

Notice that in the Equivalent Fractions Property, the values that would make the denominators zero are specifically
disallowed. We see b ≠ 0, c ≠ 0 clearly stated.

To simplify rational expressions, we first write the numerator and denominator in factored form. Then we remove the
common factors using the Equivalent Fractions Property.

Be very careful as you remove common factors. Factors are multiplied to make a product. You can remove a factor from a
product. You cannot remove a term from a sum.

Removing the x’s from x + 5

would be like cancelling the 2’s in the fraction 2 + 5

We now summarize the steps you should follow to simplify rational expressions.

HOW TO : : SIMPLIFY A RATIONAL EXPRESSION.

Step 1.

Factor the numerator and denominator completely.

Step 2.

Simplify by dividing out common factors.

Usually, we leave the simplified rational expression in factored form. This way, it is easy to check that we have removed all

the common factors.

We’ll use the methods we have learned to factor the polynomials in the numerators and denominators in the following
examples.

Every time we write a rational expression, we should make a statement disallowing values that would make a denominator
zero. However, to let us focus on the work at hand, we will omit writing it in the examples.

.

Now we will see how to simplify a rational expression whose numerator and denominator have opposite factors. We
previously introduced opposite notation: the opposite of a is −a and −a = −1 · a.

The numerical fraction, say 7
−7

simplifies to −1 . We also recognize that the numerator and denominator are opposites.

The fraction a

−a , whose numerator and denominator are opposites also simplifies to −1 .
Let’s look at the expression b − a.
Rewrite.
Factor out –1.

b − a
−a + b
−1(a − b)

This tells us that b − a is the opposite of a − b.
In general, we could write the opposite of a − b as b − a. So the rational expression a − b
b − a

simplifies to −1.

Opposites in a Rational Expression

The opposite of a − b is b − a.

An expression and its opposite divide to −1.

a − b
b − a

= −1 a ≠ b

644

Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions

We will use this property to simplify rational expressions that contain opposites in their numerators and denominators.
Be careful not to treat a + b and b + a as opposites. Recall that in addition, order doesn’t matter so a + b = b + a . So
if a ≠ −b , then a + b
b + a

= 1.

Multiply Rational Expressions

To multiply rational expressions, we do just what we did with numerical fractions. We multiply the numerators and
multiply the denominators. Then, if there are any common factors, we remove them to simplify the result.

Multiplication of Rational Expressions

If p, q, r, and s are polynomials where q ≠ 0, s ≠ 0,

then

p
q · r

s =

pr
qs

To multiply rational expressions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.

Remember, throughout this chapter, we will assume that all numerical values that would make the denominator be zero
are excluded. We will not write the restrictions for each rational expression, but keep in mind that the denominator can
never be zero. So in this next example, x ≠ 0, x ≠ 3, and x ≠ 4.

Divide Rational Expressions

Just like we did for numerical fractions, to divide rational expressions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the
second.

Division of Rational Expressions

If p, q, r, and s are polynomials where q ≠ 0, r ≠ 0, s ≠ 0,
p
q ÷ r

s =

then

p
q · s
r

To divide rational expressions, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.

Once we rewrite the division as multiplication of the first expression by the reciprocal of the second, we then factor
everything and look for common factors.

the denominator or both. Also, remember a fraction bar means division. A complex fraction is another way of writing
division of two fractions.

Multiply and Divide Rational Functions
We started this section stating that a rational expression is an expression of the form p

q , where p and q are polynomials

and q ≠ 0. Similarly, we define a rational function as a function of the form R(x) =

p(x)
q(x)

where p(x) and q(x) are

polynomial functions and q(x) is not zero.

Rational Function

A rational function is a function of the form

where p(x) and q(x) are polynomial functions and q(x) is not zero.

R(x) =

p(x)
q(x)

The domain of a rational function is all real numbers except for those values that would cause division by zero. We must
eliminate any values that make q(x) = 0.

HOW TO : : DETERMINE THE DOMAIN OF A RATIONAL FUNCTION.

Step 1.

Set the denominator equal to zero.

Step 2.

Solve the equation.

Step 3.

The domain is all real numbers excluding the values found in Step 2.

Add and Subtract Rational Expressions with a Common Denominator

What is the first step you take when you add numerical fractions? You check if they have a common denominator. If
they do, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. If they do not have a common
denominator, you find one before you add.

It is the same with rational expressions. To add rational expressions, they must have a common denominator. When the
denominators are the same, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator.

Rational Expression Addition and Subtraction

If p, q, and r are polynomials where r ≠ 0,

then

p
r +

q
r =

p + q
r

and

p
r −

q
r =

p − q
r

To add or subtract rational expressions with a common denominator, add or subtract the numerators and place the result
over the common denominator.

We always simplify rational expressions. Be sure to factor, if possible, after you subtract the numerators so you can
identify any common factors.

Remember, too, we do not allow values that would make the denominator zero. What value of x should be excluded in the
next example?

EXAMPLE 7.13

Add: 11x + 28

x + 4

+ x2
x + 4

.

Solution

Since the denominator is x + 4, we must exclude the value x = −4.

To subtract rational expressions, they must also have a common denominator. When the denominators are the same,
you subtract the numerators and place the difference over the common denominator. Be careful of the signs when you
subtract a binomial or trinomial.

Find the Least Common Denominator of Rational Expressions

When we add or subtract rational expressions with unlike denominators, we will need to get common denominators. If
we review the procedure we used with numerical fractions, we will know what to do with rational expressions.

Let’s look at this example: 7
12

+ 5
18

denominator (LCD).

. Since the denominators are not the same, the first step was to find the least common

To find the LCD of the fractions, we factored 12 and 18 into primes, lining up any common primes in columns. Then we
“brought down” one prime from each column. Finally, we multiplied the factors to find the LCD.

When we add numerical fractions, once we found the LCD, we rewrote each fraction as an equivalent fraction with the
LCD by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number. We are now ready to add.

We do the same thing for rational expressions. However, we leave the LCD in factored form.

Simplify a Complex Rational Expression by Writing it as Division

Complex fractions are fractions in which the numerator or denominator contains a fraction. We previously simplified
complex fractions like these:

3
4
5
8

x
2
xy
6

In this section, we will simplify complex rational expressions, which are rational expressions with rational expressions in
the numerator or denominator.

Complex Rational Expression

A complex rational expression is a rational expression in which the numerator and/or the denominator contains a
rational expression.

Here are a few complex rational expressions:

4
y − 3
8
y2 − 9

x + 1
1
y
y
x
y −
x

2
x + 6

4

x − 6 − 4

x2 − 36

Remember, we always exclude values that would make any denominator zero.

We will use two methods to simplify complex rational expressions.

We have already seen this complex rational expression earlier in this chapter.

6x2 − 7x + 2
4x − 8
2x2 − 8x + 3
x2 − 5x + 6

We noted that fraction bars tell us to divide, so rewrote it as the division problem:

⎛
⎝

6x2 − 7x + 2
4x − 8

⎞
⎠ ÷

⎛
2x2 − 8x + 3
⎝
x2 − 5x + 6

⎞
⎠.

Then, we multiplied the first rational expression by the reciprocal of the second, just like we do when we divide two
fractions.

This is one method to simplify complex rational expressions. We make sure the complex rational expression is of the form

Are there any value(s) of x that should not be allowed? The original complex rational expression had denominators of
x − 4 and x2 − 16. This expression would be undefined if x = 4 or x = −4.

Simplify a Complex Rational Expression by Using the LCD

We “cleared” the fractions by multiplying by the LCD when we solved equations with fractions. We can use that strategy
here to simplify complex rational expressions. We will multiply the numerator and denominator by the LCD of all the
rational expressions.

Let’s look at the complex rational expression we simplified one way in Example 7.25. We will simplify it here by multiplying
the numerator and denominator by the LCD. When we multiply by LCD
LCD

we are multiplying by 1, so the value stays the

same.

After defining the terms ‘expression’ and ‘equation’ earlier, we have used them throughout this book. We have simplified
many kinds of expressions and solved many kinds of equations. We have simplified many rational expressions so far in this
chapter. Now we will solve a rational equation.

Rational Equation

A rational equation is an equation that contains a rational expression.

You must make sure to know the difference between rational expressions and rational equations. The equation contains
an equal sign.

Solve Rational Equations

We have already solved linear equations that contained fractions. We found the LCD of all the fractions in the equation
and then multiplied both sides of the equation by the LCD to “clear” the fractions.

We will use the same strategy to solve rational equations. We will multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. Then,
we will have an equation that does not contain rational expressions and thus is much easier for us to solve. But because
the original equation may have a variable in a denominator, we must be careful that we don’t end up with a solution that
would make a denominator equal to zero.

So before we begin solving a rational equation, we examine it first to find the values that would make any denominators
zero. That way, when we solve a rational equation we will know if there are any algebraic solutions we must discard.

An algebraic solution to a rational equation that would cause any of the rational expressions to be undefined is called an
extraneous solution to a rational equation.

Extraneous Solution to a Rational Equation

An extraneous solution to a rational equation is an algebraic solution that would cause any of the expressions in
the original equation to be undefined.

We note any possible extraneous solutions, c, by writing x ≠ c next to the equation.

Solve a Rational Equation for a Specific Variable

When we solved linear equations, we learned how to solve a formula for a specific variable. Many formulas used
in business, science, economics, and other fields use rational equations to model the relation between two or more
variables. We will now see how to solve a rational equation for a specific variable.

When we developed the point-slope formula from our slope formula, we cleared the fractions by multiplying by the LCD.

Multiply both sides of the equation by x − x1.

Simplify.
Rewrite the equation with the y terms on the left.

m =

y − y1
x − x1
y − y1
⎛
⎝
x − x1
m(x − x1) = y − y1

m(x − x1) =

⎞
⎠(x − x1)

y − y1 = m(x − x1)

In the next example, we will use the same technique with the formula for slope that we used to get the point-slope form
of an equation of a line through the point (2, 3). We will add one more step to solve for y.

Solve Proportions

When two rational expressions are equal, the equation relating them is called a proportion.

Proportion

A proportion is an equation of the form a
b

= c
d

, where b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0.

The proportion is read “a is to b as c is to d.”

The equation 1
2

= 4
8

is a proportion because the two fractions are equal. The proportion 1
2

= 4
8

is read “1 is to 2 as 4 is

to 8.”

Since a proportion is an equation with rational expressions, we will solve proportions the same way we solved rational
equations. We’ll multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to clear the fractions and then solve the resulting equation.

EXAMPLE 7.43

Solve:

n
n + 14

Solution

Remove common factors on each side.

To solve applications with proportions, we will follow our usual strategy for solving applications But when we set up the
proportion, we must make sure to have the units correct—the units in the numerators must match each other and the
units in the denominators must also match each other.

EXAMPLE 7.44

pounds of the child’s weight. If Zoe weighs 80 pounds, how many milliliters of acetaminophen will her doctor prescribe?

Solve similar figure applications

When you shrink or enlarge a photo on a phone or tablet, figure out a distance on a map, or use a pattern to build a
bookcase or sew a dress, you are working with similar figures. If two figures have exactly the same shape, but different
sizes, they are said to be similar. One is a scale model of the other. All their corresponding angles have the same measures
and their corresponding sides have the same ratio.

Similar Figures

Two figures are similar if the measures of their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides have
the same ratio.

For example, the two triangles in Figure 7.2 are similar. Each side of ΔABC is four times the length of the corresponding
side of ΔXYZ.

Figure 7.2

This is summed up in the Property of Similar Triangles.

Property of Similar Triangles

Solve Uniform Motion Applications

We have solved uniform motion problems using the formula D = rt in previous chapters. We used a table like the one
below to organize the information and lead us to the equation.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5

Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions

705

The formula D = rt assumes we know r and t and use them to find D. If we know D and r and need to find t, we would
solve the equation for t and get the formula t = D
r .

We have also explained how flying with or against the wind affects the speed of a plane. We will revisit that idea in the
next example.

EXAMPLE 7.47

An airplane can fly 200 miles into a 30 mph headwind in the same amount of time it takes to fly 300 miles with a 30 mph
tailwind. What is the speed of the airplane?

Solution

This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation.

We fill in the chart to organize the information.

We are looking for the speed of the airplane.

Let r = the speed of the airplane.

When the plane flies with the wind,
the wind increases its speed and so the rate is r + 30.

When the plane flies against the wind,
the wind decreases its speed and the rate is r − 30.

Write in the rates.
Write in the distances.

Since D = r · t, we solve for t and get t = D
r .

We divide the distance by the rate in each row, and
place the expression in the time column.

We know the times are equal and so we write
our equation.

200
r − 30

= 300
r + 30

We multiply both sides by the LCD.

⎛

In the next example, we will know the total time resulting from travelling different distances at different speeds.

EXAMPLE 7.48

Jazmine trained for 3 hours on Saturday. She ran 8 miles and then biked 24 miles. Her biking speed is 4 mph faster than
her running speed. What is her running speed?

Solution

This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation.

We fill in the chart to organize the information.

We are looking for Jazmine’s running speed.

Let r = Jazmine’s running speed.

Her biking speed is 4 miles faster than her
running speed.

The distances are given, enter them into the chart.

Since D = r · t, we solve for t and get t = D
r .

We divide the distance by the rate in each row, and place the
expression in the time column.

Solve Work Applications

The weekly gossip magazine has a big story about the Princess’ baby and the editor wants the magazine to be printed as
soon as possible. She has asked the printer to run an extra printing press to get the printing done more quickly. Press #1
takes 6 hours to do the job and Press #2 takes 12 hours to do the job. How long will it take the printer to get the magazine
printed with both presses running together?

This is a typical ‘work’ application. There are three quantities involved here—the time it would take each of the two
presses to do the job alone and the time it would take for them to do the job together.

If Press #1 can complete the job in 6 hours, in one hour it would complete 1
6

of the job.

If Press #2 can complete the job in 12 hours, in one hour it would complete 1
12

of the job.

We will let t be the number of hours it would take the presses to print the magazines with both presses running together.
So in 1 hour working together they have completed 1
t

of the job.

We can model this with the word equation and then translate to a rational equation. To find the time it would take the
presses to complete the job if they worked together, we solve for t.

A chart will help us organize the information. We are looking for how many hours it would take to complete the job with
both presses running together.

Solve Direct Variation Problems

When two quantities are related by a proportion, we say they are proportional to each other. Another way to express this
relation is to talk about the variation of the two quantities. We will discuss direct variation and inverse variation in this
section.

Lindsay gets paid $15 per hour at her job. If we let s be her salary and h be the number of hours she has worked, we could
model this situation with the equation

Lindsay’s salary is the product of a constant, 15, and the number of hours she works. We say that Lindsay’s salary varies
directly with the number of hours she works. Two variables vary directly if one is the product of a constant and the other.

s = 15h

Direct Variation

For any two variables x and y, y varies directly with x if

The constant k is called the constant of variation.

y = kx, where k ≠ 0

In applications using direct variation, generally we will know values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find
the equation that relates x and y. Then we can use that equation to find values of y for other values of x.

We’ll list the steps here.

HOW TO : : SOLVE DIRECT VARIATION PROBLEMS.

Step 1.

Write the formula for direct variation.

Step 2.

Substitute the given values for the variables.

Step 3.

Solve for the constant of variation.

Step 4.

Write the equation that relates x and y using the constant of variation.

Now we’ll solve an application of direct variation.

EXAMPLE 7.52

When Raoul runs on the treadmill at the gym, the number of calories, c, he burns varies directly with the number of
minutes, m, he uses the treadmill. He burned 315 calories when he used the treadmill for 18 minutes.

ⓐ Write the equation that relates c and m. ⓑ How many calories would he burn if he ran on the treadmill for 25 minutes?

Solution

ⓐ

Write the formula for direct variation.

The number of calories, c, varies directly with
the number of minutes, m, on the treadmill,
and c = 315 when m = 18 .

TRY IT : : 7.104

The distance a moving body travels, d, varies directly with time, t, it moves. A train travels 100 miles in 2 hours

ⓐ Write the equation that relates d and t. ⓑ How many miles would it travel in 5 hours?

Solve Inverse Variation Problems

Many applications involve two variable that vary inversely. As one variable increases, the other decreases. The equation
that relates them is y = k
x.

Inverse Variation

For any two variables x and y, y varies inversely with x if

The constant k is called the constant of variation.

y = k

x, where k ≠ 0

The word ‘inverse’ in inverse variation refers to the multiplicative inverse. The multiplicative inverse of x is 1
x.

We solve inverse variation problems in the same way we solved direct variation problems. Only the general form of the
equation has changed. We will copy the procedure box here and just change ‘direct’ to ‘inverse’.

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.6.

2. Solve: 8 − 2x < 12.

3. Write in interval notation: −3 ≤ x < 5.

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.49.

Solve Rational Inequalities

We learned to solve linear inequalities after learning to solve linear equations. The techniques were very much the same
with one major exception. When we multiplied or divided by a negative number, the inequality sign reversed.

Having just learned to solve rational equations we are now ready to solve rational inequalities. A rational inequality is an
inequality that contains a rational expression.

Rational Inequality

A rational inequality is an inequality that contains a rational expression.

Inequalities such as 3
2x

> 1,

2x
x − 3

< 4, 2x − 3
x − 6

≥ x, and 1
4

x2 ≤ 3
− 2

x are rational inequalities as they each contain

a rational expression.

When we solve a rational inequality, we will use many of the techniques we used solving linear inequalities. We especially
must remember that when we multiply or divide by a negative number, the inequality sign must reverse.

Another difference is that we must carefully consider what value might make the rational expression undefined and so
must be excluded.

When we solve an equation and the result is x = 3, we know there is one solution, which is 3.

When we solve an inequality and the result is x > 3, we know there are many solutions. We graph the result to better
help show all the solutions, and we start with 3. Three becomes a critical point and then we decide whether to shade to
the left or right of it. The numbers to the right of 3 are larger than 3, so we shade to the right.

To solve a rational inequality, we first must write the inequality with only one quotient on the left and 0 on the right.

Next we determine the critical points to use to divide the number line into intervals. A critical point is a number which
make the rational expression zero or undefined.

We then will evaluate the factors of the numerator and denominator, and find the quotient in each interval. This will
identify the interval, or intervals, that contains all the solutions of the rational inequality.

We write the solution in interval notation being careful to determine whether the endpoints are included.

Solve and write the solution in interval notation: x − 1
x + 3

Solution

Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions

Step 1. Write the inequality as one quotient on the left and zero on the right.

Our inequality is in this form.

x − 1
x + 3

≥ 0

Step 2. Determine the critical points—the points where the rational expression will be zero or undefined.

The rational expression will be zero when the numerator is zero. Since x − 1 = 0 when x = 1,

then 1 is a critical point.

The rational expression will be undefined when the denominator is zero. Since x + 3 = 0 when x = −3,
critical point.

then −3 is a

The critical points are 1 and −3.

Step 3. Use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals.

The number line is divided into three intervals:

(−∞, −3)

(−3, 1)

(1, ∞)

Step 4. Test a value in each interval. Above the number line show the sign of each factor of the rational expression in each
interval. Below the number line show the sign of the quotient.

To find the sign of each factor in an interval, we choose any point in that interval and use it as a test point. Any point in
the interval will give the expression the same sign, so we can choose any point in the interval.

Interval ⎛

⎝−∞, −3⎞

⎠

The number −4 is in the interval (−∞, −3). Test x = −4 in the expression in the numerator and the denominator.

Above the number line, mark the factor x − 1 negative and mark the factor x + 3 negative.

Since a negative divided by a negative is positive, mark the quotient positive in the interval (−∞, −3).

Interval ⎛

⎝−3, 1⎞

⎠

The number 0 is in the interval (−3, 1). Test x = 0.

Above the number line, mark the factor x − 1 negative and mark x + 3 positive.

Since a negative divided by a positive is negative, the quotient is marked negative in the interval (−3, 1).

Interval ⎛

⎝1, ∞⎞

⎠

The number 2 is in the interval (1, ∞). Test x = 2.

Above the number line, mark the factor x − 1 positive and mark x + 3 positive.

Since a positive divided by a positive is positive, mark the quotient positive in the interval (1, ∞).

Step 5. Determine the intervals where the inequality is correct. Write the solution in interval notation.

We want the quotient to be greater than or equal to zero, so the numbers in the intervals (−∞, −3) and (1, ∞) are
solutions.

But what about the critical points?

The critical point x = −3 makes the denominator 0, so it must be excluded from the solution and we mark it with a
parenthesis.

The critical point x = 1 makes the whole rational expression 0. The inequality requires that the rational expression be
greater than or equal to. So, 1 is part of the solution and we will mark it with a bracket.

Recall that when we have a solution made up of more than one interval we use the union symbol, ∪ ,
two intervals. The solution in interval notation is (−∞, −3) ∪ [1, ∞).

undefined.

Step 3.

Use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals.

Step 4.

numerator and denominator in each interval. Below the number line show the sign of the
quotient.

Step 5.

Determine the intervals where the inequality is correct. Write the solution in interval notation.

The next example requires that we first get the rational inequality into the correct form.

Above the number line show the sign of each factor of the rational expression in each interval.
Below the number line show the sign of the quotient.

Determine the intervals where the inequality is correct. We want the quotient to be negative, so the
solution includes the points between −2 and 6. Since the inequality is strictly less than, the endpoints are
not included.

We write the solution in interval notation as (−2, 6).

Imagine charging your cell phone is less than five seconds. Consider cleaning radioactive waste from contaminated water.
Think about filtering salt from ocean water to make an endless supply of drinking water. Ponder the idea of bionic
devices that can repair spinal injuries. These are just of few of the many possible uses of a material called graphene.
Materials scientists are developing a material made up of a single layer of carbon atoms that is stronger than any other
material, completely flexible, and conducts electricity better than most metals. Research into this type of material requires
a solid background in mathematics, including understanding roots and radicals. In this chapter, you will learn to simplify
expressions containing roots and radicals, perform operations on radical expressions and equations, and evaluate radical
functions.

Simplify Expressions with Roots

In Foundations, we briefly looked at square roots. Remember that when a real number n is multiplied by itself, we write
n2 and read it ‘n squared’. This number is called the square of n, and n is called the square root. For example,

132 is read “13 squared”
169 is called the square of 13, since 132 = 169

13 is a square root of 169

Square and Square Root of a number

Square

Square Root

If n2 = m, then m is the square of n.

If n2 = m, then n is a square root of m.

Notice (−13)2 = 169 also, so −13 is also a square root of 169. Therefore, both 13 and −13 are square roots of 169.

So, every positive number has two square roots—one positive and one negative. What if we only wanted the positive
square root of a positive number? We use a radical sign, and write, m, which denotes the positive square root of m. The
positive square root is also called the principal square root.

We also use the radical sign for the square root of zero. Because 02 = 0,
root.

0 = 0. Notice that zero has only one square

Square Root Notation

m is read “the square root of m”.
If n2 = m, then n = m, for n ≥ 0.

We know that every positive number has two square roots and the radical sign indicates the positive one. We write
169 = 13. If we want to find the negative square root of a number, we place a negative in front of the radical sign. For

example, − 169 = −13.

EXAMPLE 8.1

Simplify: ⓐ 144 ⓑ − 289.

Solution

ⓐ

Since 122 = 144.

Since 172 = 289 and the negative is in

So far we have only talked about squares and square roots. Let’s now extend our work to include higher powers and
higher roots.

Let’s review some vocabulary first.

We write:
n2
n3
n4
n5

We say:

n squared

n cubed
n to the fourth power

n to the fifth power

The terms ‘squared’ and ‘cubed’ come from the formulas for area of a square and volume of a cube.

It will be helpful to have a table of the powers of the integers from −5 to 5. See Figure 8.2.

Figure 8.2

Notice the signs in the table. All powers of positive numbers are positive, of course. But when we have a negative number,
the even powers are positive and the odd powers are negative. We’ll copy the row with the powers of −2 to help you see

748

this.

Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals

We will now extend the square root definition to higher roots.

nth Root of a Number

If bn = a, then b is an nth root of a.
The principal nth root of a is written an .
n is called the index of the radical.

Just like we use the word ‘cubed’ for b3, we use the term ‘cube root’ for a3 .
We can refer to Figure 8.2 to help find higher roots.

Could we have an even root of a negative number? We know that the square root of a negative number is not a real
number. The same is true for any even root. Even roots of negative numbers are not real numbers. Odd roots of negative
numbers are real numbers.

Properties of an

Estimate and Approximate Roots

When we see a number with a radical sign, we often don’t think about its numerical value. While we probably know that

the 4 = 2, what is the value of 21 or 50
convenient to have a decimal approximation.

? In some situations a quick estimate is meaningful and in others it is

To get a numerical estimate of a square root, we look for perfect square numbers closest to the radicand. To find an
estimate of 11, we see 11 is between perfect square numbers 9 and 16, closer to 9. Its square root then will be between
3 and 4, but closer to 3.

Similarly, to estimate 91
4 and 5.

3

, we see 91 is between perfect cube numbers 64 and 125. The cube root then will be between

There are mathematical methods to approximate square roots, but nowadays most people use a calculator to find square

key.

When you use these keys, you get an approximate value. It is an approximation, accurate to the number of digits shown
on your calculator’s display. The symbol for an approximation is ≈ and it is read ‘approximately’.

Suppose your calculator has a 10 digit display. You would see that

5 ≈ 2.236067978 rounded to two decimal places is 5 ≈ 2.24

How do we know these values are approximations and not the exact values? Look at what happens when we square them:

(2.236067978)2 = 5.000000002
(2.24)2 = 5.0176

(3.105422799)4 = 92.999999991
(3.11)4 = 93.54951841

Simplify Variable Expressions with Roots

The odd root of a number can be either positive or negative. For example,

But what about an even root? We want the principal root, so 625

= 5.

But notice,

752

Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals

How can we make sure the fourth root of −5 raised to the fourth power is 5? We can use the absolute value. |−5| = 5. So
we say that when n is even ann

= |a|. This guarantees the principal root is positive.

Simplifying Odd and Even Roots

For any integer n ≥ 2,

when the index n is odd

when the index n is even

ann
ann

= a

= |a|

What about square roots of higher powers of variables? The Power Property of Exponents says (am)n = am · n. So if we
square am, the exponent will become 2m.

(am)2 = a2m

…with some help. This must be addressed quickly because topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success.
In math every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on.
Who can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math
tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved?

…no - I don’t get it! This is a warning sign and you must not ignore it. You should get help right away or you will quickly be

Use the Product Property to Simplify Radical Expressions

We will simplify radical expressions in a way similar to how we simplified fractions. A fraction is simplified if there are
no common factors in the numerator and denominator. To simplify a fraction, we look for any common factors in the
numerator and denominator.
A radical expression, an ,
for any factors in the radicand that are powers of the index.

is considered simplified if it has no factors of mn. So, to simplify a radical expression, we look

For real numbers a and m, and n ≥ 2,

an

is considered simplified if a has no factors of mn

For example,
because 12 has a perfect square factor of 4.

5 is considered simplified because there are no perfect square factors in 5. But

12 is not simplified

Similarly,

To simplify radical expressions, we will also use some properties of roots. The properties we will use to simplify radical
expressions are similar to the properties of exponents. We know that (ab)n = an bn. The corresponding of Product

Property of Roots says that ab

= an · b

If an

and

We use the Product Property of Roots to remove all perfect square factors from a square root.

HOW TO : : SIMPLIFY A RADICAL EXPRESSION USING THE PRODUCT PROPERTY.

Step 1.

Find the largest factor in the radicand that is a perfect power of the index. Rewrite the radicand
as a product of two factors, using that factor.

Step 2.

Use the product rule to rewrite the radical as the product of two radicals.

Step 3.

Simplify the root of the perfect power.

We will apply this method in the next example. It may be helpful to have a table of perfect squares, cubes, and fourth
powers.

We have seen how to use the order of operations to simplify some expressions with radicals. In the next example, we
have the sum of an integer and a square root. We simplify the square root but cannot add the resulting expression to
the integer since one term contains a radical and the other does not. The next example also includes a fraction with a
radical in the numerator. Remember that in order to simplify a fraction you need a common factor in the numerator and
denominator.

Use the Quotient Property to Simplify Radical Expressions

Whenever you have to simplify a radical expression, the first step you should take is to determine whether the radicand
is a perfect power of the index. If not, check the numerator and denominator for any common factors, and remove them.
You may find a fraction in which both the numerator and the denominator are perfect powers of the index.

Simplify Expressions with a

n

Rational exponents are another way of writing expressions with radicals. When we use rational exponents, we can apply
the properties of exponents to simplify expressions.
The Power Property for Exponents says that (am)n = am · n when m and n are whole numbers. Let’s assume we are now
not limited to whole numbers.
Suppose we want to find a number p such that (8 p)3 = 8. We will use the Power Property of Exponents to find the value
of p.

(8 p)3 = 8

Multiply the exponents on the left.

Write the exponent 1 on the right.
Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.

Solve for p.

3p

8

3p

= 8
= 81
8
3p = 1
p = 1

So

3

⎛
⎜8
⎝

⎞
⎟
⎠

= 8. But we know also

3

3 ⎞
⎛
⎝ 8
⎠

= 8. Then it must be that 8

The denominator of the rational exponent is the index of the radical.

There will be times when working with expressions will be easier if you use rational exponents and times when it will be
easier if you use radicals. In the first few examples, you’ll practice converting expressions between these two notations.

Simplify Expressions with a

m
n

We can look at a

m
n in two ways. Remember the Power Property tells us to multiply the exponents and so

m

⎛
⎜a
⎝

1
n

⎞
⎟
⎠

and

780

1
n

(am)

both equal a

m
n . If we write these expressions in radical form, we get

m
n =

a

m

⎛
⎜a
⎝

⎞
⎟
⎠

= ( an )m and a

m
n = (am)

n = amn

Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals

This leads us to the following definition.

Rational Exponent a

m

For any positive integers m and n,

Which form do we use to simplify an expression? We usually take the root first—that way we keep the numbers in the
radicand smaller, before raising it to the power indicated.

8.4 Add, Subtract, and Multiply Radical Expressions

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Add and subtract radical expressions
Multiply radical expressions
Use polynomial multiplication to multiply radical expressions

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Add: 3x2 + 9x − 5 −

⎛
⎝x2 − 2x + 3

⎞
⎠.

If you missed this problem, review Example 5.5.

2. Simplify: (2 + a)(4 − a).

If you missed this problem, review Example 5.28.

3. Simplify: ⎛

⎝9 − 5y⎞

⎠

If you missed this problem, review Example 5.31.

Add and Subtract Radical Expressions

Adding radical expressions with the same index and the same radicand is just like adding like terms. We call radicals with
the same index and the same radicand like radicals to remind us they work the same as like terms.

Like Radicals

Like radicals are radical expressions with the same index and the same radicand.

We add and subtract like radicals in the same way we add and subtract like terms. We know that 3x + 8x is 11x. Similarly
we add 3 x + 8 x and the result is 11 x.

Think about adding like terms with variables as you do the next few examples. When you have like radicals, you just add
or subtract the coefficients. When the radicals are not like, you cannot combine the terms.

EXAMPLE 8.36

Simplify: ⓐ 2 2 − 7 2 ⓑ 5 y3 + 4 y3 ⓒ 7 x4 − 2 y4 .

Solution

ⓐ

Since the radicals are like, we subtract the
coefficients.
ⓑ

Since the radicals are like, we add the
coefficients.

subtract them.

For radicals to be like, they must have the same index and radicand. When the radicands contain more than one variable,
as long as all the variables and their exponents are identical, the radicands are the same.

Remember that we always simplify radicals by removing the largest factor from the radicand that is a power of the index.
Once each radical is simplified, we can then decide if they are like radicals.

In the next example, we will remove both constant and variable factors from the radicals. Now that we have practiced
taking both the even and odd roots of variables, it is common practice at this point for us to assume all variables are
greater than or equal to zero so that absolute values are not needed. We will use this assumption throughout the rest of
this chapter.

Multiply Radical Expressions

We have used the Product Property of Roots to simplify square roots by removing the perfect square factors. We can use
the Product Property of Roots ‘in reverse’ to multiply square roots. Remember, we assume all variables are greater than
or equal to zero.

We will rewrite the Product Property of Roots so we see both ways together.

When we multiply two radicals they must have the same index. Once we multiply the radicals, we then look for factors
that are a power of the index and simplify the radical whenever possible.

Multiplying radicals with coefficients is much like multiplying variables with coefficients. To multiply 4x · 3y we multiply
the coefficients together and then the variables. The result is 12xy. Keep this in mind as you do these examples.

When we worked with polynomials, we multiplied binomials by binomials. Remember, this gave us four products before
we combined any like terms. To be sure to get all four products, we organized our work—usually by the FOIL method.

Recognizing some special products made our work easier when we multiplied binomials earlier. This is true when we
multiply radicals, too. The special product formulas we used are shown here.

Divide Radical Expressions

We have used the Quotient Property of Radical Expressions to simplify roots of fractions. We will need to use this property
‘in reverse’ to simplify a fraction with radicals.

We give the Quotient Property of Radical Expressions again for easy reference. Remember, we assume all variables are
greater than or equal to zero so that no absolute value bars re needed.

Quotient Property of Radical Expressions

If an

n

and b

are real numbers, b ≠ 0, and for any integer n ≥ 2 then,

n

a
b

= an
b

n

and

an
n
n = a
b
b

We will use the Quotient Property of Radical Expressions when the fraction we start with is the quotient of two radicals,
and neither radicand is a perfect power of the index. When we write the fraction in a single radical, we may find common
factors in the numerator and denominator.

Rationalize a One Term Denominator

Before the calculator became a tool of everyday life, approximating the value of a fraction with a radical
denominator was a very cumbersome process!

in the

For this reason, a process called rationalizing the denominator was developed. A fraction with a radical
in the
denominator is converted to an equivalent fraction whose denominator is an integer. Square roots of numbers that are
not perfect squares are irrational numbers. When we rationalize the denominator, we write an equivalent fraction with a

rational number in the denominator.

This process is still used today, and is useful in other areas of mathematics, too.

Rationalizing the Denominator

Rationalizing the denominator is the process of converting a fraction with a radical in the denominator to an
equivalent fraction whose denominator is an integer.

Even though we have calculators available nearly everywhere, a fraction with a radical in the denominator still must be
rationalized. It is not considered simplified if the denominator contains a radical.

Similarly, a radical expression is not considered simplified if the radicand contains a fraction.

Simplified Radical Expressions

A radical expression is considered simplified if there are

• no factors in the radicand have perfect powers of the index

• no fractions in the radicand

• no radicals in the denominator of a fraction

To rationalize a denominator with a square root, we use the property that ( a)2 = a. If we square an irrational square
root, we get a rational number.

We will use this property to rationalize the denominator in the next example.

EXAMPLE 8.50

.

Solution

To rationalize a denominator with one term, we can multiply a square root by itself. To keep the fraction equivalent, we
multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same factor.

ⓐ

Multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3.

Simplify.

ⓑ We always simplify the radical in the denominator first, before we rationalize it. This way the numbers stay smaller and
easier to work with.

The fraction is not a perfect square, so rewrite using the
Quotient Property.

Simplify the denominator.

Multiply the numerator and denominator by 5.

When we rationalized a square root, we multiplied the numerator and denominator by a square root that would give us
a perfect square under the radical in the denominator. When we took the square root, the denominator no longer had a
radical.

We will follow a similar process to rationalize higher roots. To rationalize a denominator with a higher index radical, we
multiply the numerator and denominator by a radical that would give us a radicand that is a perfect power of the index.
When we simplify the new radical, the denominator will no longer have a radical.

For example,

We will use this technique in the next examples.

Solution

To rationalize a denominator with a cube root, we can multiply by a cube root that will give us a perfect cube in the
radicand in the denominator. To keep the fraction equivalent, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by the
same factor.

ⓐ

The radical in the denominator has one factor of 6.
3

Multiply both the numerator and denominator by 62
which gives us 2 more factors of 6.

has 3 powers of 6.

Solve Radical Equations

In this section we will solve equations that have a variable in the radicand of a radical expression. An equation of this type
is called a radical equation.

Radical Equation

An equation in which a variable is in the radicand of a radical expression is called a radical equation.

As usual, when solving these equations, what we do to one side of an equation we must do to the other side as well. Once
we isolate the radical, our strategy will be to raise both sides of the equation to the power of the index. This will eliminate
the radical.

Solving radical equations containing an even index by raising both sides to the power of the index may introduce an
algebraic solution that would not be a solution to the original radical equation. Again, we call this an extraneous solution
as we did when we solved rational equations.

In the next example, we will see how to solve a radical equation. Our strategy is based on raising a radical with index n to
the nth power. This will eliminate the radical.

EXAMPLE 8.56 HOW TO SOLVE A RADICAL EQUATION

For a ≥ 0, ( an )n = a.

Solve: 5n − 4 − 9 = 0.

TRY IT : : 8.112

Solve: 10z + 1 − 2 = 0.

HOW TO : : SOLVE A RADICAL EQUATION WITH ONE RADICAL.

Step 1.

Isolate the radical on one side of the equation.

Step 2.

Raise both sides of the equation to the power of the index.

Step 3.

Solve the new equation.

Step 4.

Check the answer in the original equation.

When we use a radical sign, it indicates the principal or positive root. If an equation has a radical with an even index equal
to a negative number, that equation will have no solution.

EXAMPLE 8.57

Solve: 9k − 2 + 1 = 0.

Solution

To isolate the radical, subtract 1 to both sides.

Simplify.

Because the square root is equal to a negative number, the equation has no solution.

square it.

Sometimes an equation will contain rational exponents instead of a radical. We use the same techniques to solve the
equation as when we have a radical. We raise each side of the equation to the power of the denominator of the rational
exponent. Since (am)n = am · n, we have for example,

Solve Radical Equations with Two Radicals

If the radical equation has two radicals, we start out by isolating one of them. It often works out easiest to isolate the
more complicated radical first.

In the next example, when one radical is isolated, the second radical is also isolated.

EXAMPLE 8.63

Solve: 4x − 3

= 3x + 2

Sometimes after raising both sides of an equation to a power, we still have a variable inside a radical. When that happens,
we repeat Step 1 and Step 2 of our procedure. We isolate the radical and raise both sides of the equation to the power of
the index again.

TRY IT : : 8.128

Solve:

x + 2 = x + 16.

We summarize the steps here. We have adjusted our previous steps to include more than one radical in the equation This
procedure will now work for any radical equations.

HOW TO : : SOLVE A RADICAL EQUATION.

Step 1.

Isolate one of the radical terms on one side of the equation.

Step 2.

Raise both sides of the equation to the power of the index.

Step 3.

Are there any more radicals?
If yes, repeat Step 1 and Step 2 again.
If no, solve the new equation.

Step 4.

Check the answer in the original equation.

Be careful as you square binomials in the next example. Remember the pattern is (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 or
(a − b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2.

EXAMPLE 8.65

Solve: q − 2 + 3 = 4q + 1.

Solution

The radical on the right is isolated. Square
both sides.

Simplify.

There is still a radical in the equation so
we must repeat the previous steps. Isolate
the radical.

Square both sides. It would not help to
divide both sides by 6. Remember to
square both the 6 and the q − 2.

Simplify, then solve the new equation.

Step 7.

Answer the question with a complete sentence.

One application of radicals has to do with the effect of gravity on falling objects. The formula allows us to determine how
long it will take a fallen object to hit the gound.

Falling Objects

On Earth, if an object is dropped from a height of h feet, the time in seconds it will take to reach the ground is found
by using the formula

For example, if an object is dropped from a height of 64 feet, we can find the time it takes to reach the ground by
substituting h = 64 into the formula.

t = h

A radical function is a function that is defined by a radical expression.

To evaluate a radical function, we find the value of f(x) for a given value of x just as we did in our previous work with
functions.

EXAMPLE 8.68

For the function f (x) = 2x − 1,

find ⓐ f (5) ⓑ f (−2).

Solution

ⓐ

To evaluate f (5), substitute 5 for x.

f (5) = 2 · 5 − 1

f (x) = 2x − 1

Simplify.
Take the square root.

ⓑ

f (5) = 9
f (5) = 3

f (x) = 2x − 1

To evaluate f (−2), substitute −2 for x.

f (−2) = 2(−2) − 1

Simplify.

f (−2) = −5

Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, the function does not have a value at x = −2.

Find the Domain of a Radical Function

To find the domain and range of radical functions, we use our properties of radicals. For a radical with an even index, we
said the radicand had to be greater than or equal to zero as even roots of negative numbers are not real numbers. For an
odd index, the radicand can be any real number. We restate the properties here for reference.

Properties of an

• a ≥ 0,

• a < 0,

is not a real number.

When n is an odd number, an

is a real number for all values of a.

So, to find the domain of a radical function with even index, we set the radicand to be greater than or equal to zero. For
an odd index radical, the radicand can be any real number.

Domain of a Radical Function

When the index of the radical is even, the radicand must be greater than or equal to zero.

When the index of the radical is odd, the radicand can be any real number.

EXAMPLE 8.71

Find the domain of the function,

f (x) = 3x − 4. Write the domain in interval notation.

Solution

Since the function,

f (x) = 3x − 4 has a radical with an index of 2, which is even, we know the radicand must be greater

than or equal to 0. We set the radicand to be greater than or equal to 0 and then solve to find the domain.

The radicand cannot be zero since the numerator is not zero.

For

to be greater than zero, the denominator must be positive since the numerator is positive. We know a positive

divided by a positive is positive.

We set x − 1 > 0 and solve.

Solve.

x − 1 > 0
x > 1

Also, since the radicand is a fraction, we must realize that the denominator cannot be zero.

We solve x − 1 = 0 to find the value that must be eliminated from the domain.

x − 1 = 0

Solve.

x = 1 so x ≠ 1 in the domain.

Putting this together we get the domain is x > 1 and we write it as (1, ∞).

Solution

Since the function,

number. This tells us the domain is any real number. In interval notation, we write (−∞, ∞).

Graph Radical Functions

Before we graph any radical function, we first find the domain of the function. For the function,

f (x) = x,

the index is

even, and so the radicand must be greater than or equal to 0.

This tells us the domain is x ≥ 0 and we write this in interval notation as [0, ∞).

Previously we used point plotting to graph the function,

f (x) = x. We chose x-values, substituted them in and then

created a chart. Notice we chose points that are perfect squares in order to make taking the square root easier.

832

Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals

Once we see the graph, we can find the range of the function. The y-values of the function are greater than or equal to
zero. The range then is [0, ∞).

EXAMPLE 8.74

For the function f (x) = x + 3,

ⓐ find the domain ⓑ graph the function ⓒ use the graph to determine the range.

Solution

ⓐ Since the radical has index 2, we know the radicand must be greater than or equal to zero. If x + 3 ≥ 0,
This tells us the domain is all values x ≥ −3 and written in interval notation as [−3, ∞).

then x ≥ −3.

ⓑ To graph the function, we choose points in the interval [−3, ∞) that will also give us a radicand which will be easy to
take the square root.

ⓒ Looking at the graph, we see the y-values of the function are greater than or equal to zero. The range then is [0, ∞).

Evaluate the Square Root of a Negative Number

Whenever we have a situation where we have a square root of a negative number we say there is no real number that
equals that square root. For example, to simplify −1, we are looking for a real number x so that x2 = –1. Since all real
numbers squared are positive numbers, there is no real number that equals –1 when squared.

Mathematicians have often expanded their numbers systems as needed. They added 0 to the counting numbers to get
the whole numbers. When they needed negative balances, they added negative numbers to get the integers. When they
needed the idea of parts of a whole they added fractions and got the rational numbers. Adding the irrational numbers
allowed numbers like 5. All of these together gave us the real numbers and so far in your study of mathematics, that
has been sufficient.

But now we will expand the real numbers to include the square roots of negative numbers. We start by defining the
imaginary unit i as the number whose square is –1.

Imaginary Unit

The imaginary unit i is the number whose square is –1.

We will use the imaginary unit to simplify the square roots of negative numbers.

i2 = −1 or i = −1

Square Root of a Negative Number

If b is a positive real number, then

We will use this definition in the next example. Be careful that it is clear that the i is not under the radical. Sometimes you
will see this written as −b = i b to emphasize the i is not under the radical. But the −b = b i is considered standard
form.

−b = b i

Now that we are familiar with the imaginary number i, we can expand the real numbers to include imaginary numbers.
The complex number system includes the real numbers and the imaginary numbers. A complex number is of the form
a + bi, where a, b are real numbers. We call a the real part and b the imaginary part.

Complex Number

A complex number is of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.

A complex number is in standard form when written as a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.

If b = 0,

then a + bi becomes a + 0 · i = a, and is a real number.

If b ≠ 0,

then a + bi is an imaginary number.

If a = 0,

then a + bi becomes 0 + bi = bi, and is called a pure imaginary number.

We summarize this here.

The diagram helps us visualize the complex number system. It is made up of both the real numbers and the imaginary
numbers.

Add or Subtract Complex Numbers

We are now ready to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the complex
numbers—just as we did with the real numbers.

Adding and subtracting complex numbers is much like adding or subtracting like terms. We add or subtract the real parts
and then add or subtract the imaginary parts. Our final result should be in standard form.

Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we cannot use the Product Property for Radicals. In
order to multiply square roots of negative numbers we should first write them as complex numbers, using −b = bi.
This is one place students tend to make errors, so be careful when you see multiplying with a negative square root.

We first looked at conjugate pairs when we studied polynomials. We said that a pair of binomials that each have the same
first term and the same last term, but one is a sum and one is a difference is called a conjugate pair and is of the form
(a − b), (a + b).

A complex conjugate pair is very similar. For a complex number of the form a + bi,

A complex conjugate pair is of the form a + bi, a − bi.

We will multiply a complex conjugate pair in the next example.

EXAMPLE 8.84

Multiply: (3 − 2i)(3 + 2i).

Solution

Use FOIL.
Combine like terms and simplify i2.

(3 − 2i)(3 + 2i)
9 + 6i − 6i − 4i2
9 − 4(−1)

Multiply and combine like terms.

TRY IT : : 8.167

Multiply: (4 − 3i) · (4 + 3i).

TRY IT : : 8.168

Multiply: (−2 + 5i) · (−2 − 5i).

From our study of polynomials, we know the product of conjugates is always of the form (a − b)(a + b) = a2 − b2. The
result is called a difference of squares. We can multiply a complex conjugate pair using this pattern.

The last example we used FOIL. Now we will use the Product of Conjugates Pattern.

842

Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals

Notice this is the same result we found in Example 8.84.

When we multiply complex conjugates, the product of the last terms will always have an i2 which simplifies to −1.

(a − bi)(a + bi)
a2 − (bi)2
a2 − b2 i2
a2 − b2 (−1)
a2 + b2

This leads us to the Product of Complex Conjugates Pattern: (a − bi)(a + bi) = a2 + b2

Product of Complex Conjugates

If a and b are real numbers, then

EXAMPLE 8.85

(a − bi)(a + bi) = a2 + b2

Multiply using the Product of Complex Conjugates Pattern: (8 − 2i)(8 + 2i).

Solution

Use the Product of Complex Conjugates Pattern,
(a − bi)(a + bi) = a2 + b2.

Simplify the squares.

i1 = i
i2 = −1
i3 = −i
i4 = 1

i5 = i
i6 = −1
i7 = −i
i8 = 1

If we continued, the pattern would keep repeating in blocks of four. We can use this pattern to help us simplify powers of
i. Since i4 = 1, we rewrite each power, in, as a product using i4 to a power and another power of i.

We rewrite it in the form in =
· ir, where the exponent, q, is the quotient of n divided by 4 and the exponent, r, is
the remainder from this division. For example, to simplify i57, we divide 57 by 4 and we get 14 with a remainder of 1. In

q

other words, 57 = 4 · 14 + 1. So we write i57 =

Introduction

Blink your eyes. You’ve taken a photo. That’s what will happen if you are wearing a contact lens with a built-in camera.
Some of the same technology used to help doctors see inside the eye may someday be used to make cameras and other
devices. These technologies are being developed by biomedical engineers using many mathematical principles, including
an understanding of quadratic equations and functions. In this chapter, you will explore these kinds of equations and
learn to solve them in different ways. Then you will solve applications modeled by quadratics, graph them, and extend
your understanding to quadratic inequalities.

9.1 Solve Quadratic Equations Using the Square Root Property

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Solve quadratic equations of the form ax2 = k using the Square Root Property
Solve quadratic equations of the form a(x – h)2 = k using the Square Root Property

Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions

If you missed this problem, review Example 8.50.

3. Factor: 9x2 − 12x + 4 .

If you missed this problem, review Example 6.23.

A quadratic equation is an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0 . Quadratic equations differ from linear
equations by including a quadratic term with the variable raised to the second power of the form ax2. We use different
methods to solve quadratic equations than linear equations, because just adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing
terms will not isolate the variable.

We have seen that some quadratic equations can be solved by factoring. In this chapter, we will learn three other methods
to use in case a quadratic equation cannot be factored.

Solve Quadratic Equations of the form ax2 = k using the Square Root Property
We have already solved some quadratic equations by factoring. Let’s review how we used factoring to solve the quadratic
equation x2 = 9.

Put the equation in standard form.
Factor the difference of squares.
Use the Zero Product Property.
Solve each equation.

x2 = 9
x2 − 9 = 0
(x − 3)(x + 3) = 0

x − 3 = 0
x = 3

x − 3 = 0

x = −3

We can easily use factoring to find the solutions of similar equations, like x2 = 16 and x2 = 25, because 16 and 25 are perfect
squares. In each case, we would get two solutions, x = 4, x = −4 and x = 5, x = −5.

But what happens when we have an equation like x2 = 7? Since 7 is not a perfect square, we cannot solve the equation by
factoring.
Previously we learned that since 169 is the square of 13, we can also say that 13 is a square root of 169. Also, (−13)2 = 169,
so −13 is also a square root of 169. Therefore, both 13 and −13 are square roots of 169. So, every positive number has two
square roots—one positive and one negative. We earlier defined the square root of a number in this way:

If n2 = m, then n is a square root of m.
Since these equations are all of the form x2 = k, the square root definition tells us the solutions are the two square roots
of k. This leads to the Square Root Property.

Square Root Property

If x2 = k, then

x = k

x = − k
Notice that the Square Root Property gives two solutions to an equation of the form x2 = k, the principal square root of k
and its opposite. We could also write the solution as x = ± k. We read this as x equals positive or negative the square
root of k.
Now we will solve the equation x2 = 9 again, this time using the Square Root Property.

x = ± k.

or

or

Use the Square Root Property.

x2 = 9
x = ± 9
x = ±3
So x = 3 or x = −3.

What happens when the constant is not a perfect square? Let’s use the Square Root Property to solve the equation x2 = 7.

Use the Square Root Property.

x = 7,

x = − 7

We cannot simplify 7 , so we leave the answer as a radical.

x2 = 7

Solve Quadratic Equations of the Form a(x − h)2 = k Using the Square Root Property
We can use the Square Root Property to solve an equation of the form a(x − h)2 = k as well. Notice that the quadratic term,
x, in the original form ax2 = k is replaced with (x − h).

The first step, like before, is to isolate the term that has the variable squared. In this case, a binomial is being squared.
Once the binomial is isolated, by dividing each side by the coefficient of a, then the Square Root Property can be used on
(x − h)2.

9.2 Solve Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Complete the square of a binomial expression
Solve quadratic equations of the form x2 + bx + c = 0 by completing the square
Solve quadratic equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 by completing the square

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Expand: (x + 9)2.

If you missed this problem, review Example 5.32.

2. Factor y2 − 14y + 49.

If you missed this problem, review Example 6.9.

3. Factor 5n2 + 40n + 80.

If you missed this problem, review Example 6.14.

So far we have solved quadratic equations by factoring and using the Square Root Property. In this section, we will solve
quadratic equations by a process called completing the square, which is important for our work on conics later.

Complete the Square of a Binomial Expression
In the last section, we were able to use the Square Root Property to solve the equation (y − 7)2 = 12 because the left side
was a perfect square.

⎛

⎠

⎝y − 7⎞

2 = 12
y − 7 = ± 12

y − 7 = ±2 3

y = 7 ± 2 3

We also solved an equation in which the left side was a perfect square trinomial, but we had to rewrite it the form
(x − k)2 in order to use the Square Root Property.

x2 − 10x + 25 = 18
(x − 5)2 = 18

What happens if the variable is not part of a perfect square? Can we use algebra to make a perfect square?

Let’s look at two examples to help us recognize the patterns.

⎛

⎝y − 7⎞

⎠

2

⎛

(x + 9)(x + 9)
x2 + 9x + 9x + 81
x2 + 18x + 81

We restate the patterns here for reference.

Binomial Squares Pattern

If a and b are real numbers,

Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions

We can use this pattern to “make” a perfect square.
We will start with the expression x2 + 6x. Since there is a plus sign between the two terms, we will use the (a + b)2 pattern,
a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2.

We ultimately need to find the last term of this trinomial that will make it a perfect square trinomial. To do that we will
need to find b. But first we start with determining a. Notice that the first term of x2 + 6x is a square, x2. This tells us that a
= x.

What number, b, when multiplied with 2x gives 6x? It would have to be 3, which is 1
2

(6). So b = 3.

Now to complete the perfect square trinomial, we will find the last term by squaring b, which is 32 = 9.

We can now factor.

So we found that adding 9 to x2 + 6x ‘completes the square’, and we write it as (x + 3)2.

Solve Quadratic Equations of the Form x2 + bx + c = 0 by Completing the Square
In solving equations, we must always do the same thing to both sides of the equation. This is true, of course, when we
solve a quadratic equation by completing the square too. When we add a term to one side of the equation to make a
perfect square trinomial, we must also add the same term to the other side of the equation.
For example, if we start with the equation x2 + 6x = 40, and we want to complete the square on the left, we will add 9 to
both sides of the equation.

Add 9 to both sides to complete the square.

Now the equation is in the form to solve using the Square Root Property! Completing the square is a way to transform an
equation into the form we need to be able to use the Square Root Property.

Solve Quadratic Equations of the Form ax2 + bx + c = 0 by Completing the Square
The process of completing the square works best when the coefficient of x2 is 1, so the left side of the equation is of the
form x2 + bx + c. If the x2 term has a coefficient other than 1, we take some preliminary steps to make the coefficient equal
to 1.

Sometimes the coefficient can be factored from all three terms of the trinomial. This will be our strategy in the next
example.

EXAMPLE 9.18

Solve by completing the square: 3x2 − 12x − 15 = 0.

Solution

To complete the square, we need the coefficient of x2 to be one. If we factor out the coefficient of x2 as a common
factor, we can continue with solving the equation by completing the square.

To complete the square, the coefficient of the x2 must be 1. When the leading coefficient is not a factor of all the terms,
we will divide both sides of the equation by the leading coefficient! This will give us a fraction for the second coefficient.
We have already seen how to complete the square with fractions in this section.

EXAMPLE 9.19

Solve by completing the square: 2x2 − 3x = 20.

Solve Quadratic Equations Using the Quadratic Formula

When we solved quadratic equations in the last section by completing the square, we took the same steps every time.
By the end of the exercise set, you may have been wondering ‘isn’t there an easier way to do this?’ The answer is ‘yes’.
Mathematicians look for patterns when they do things over and over in order to make their work easier. In this section we
will derive and use a formula to find the solution of a quadratic equation.

We have already seen how to solve a formula for a specific variable ‘in general’, so that we would do the algebraic steps
only once, and then use the new formula to find the value of the specific variable. Now we will go through the steps of
completing the square using the general form of a quadratic equation to solve a quadratic equation for x.

We start with the standard form of a quadratic equation and solve it for x by completing the square.

Isolate the variable terms on one side.

Make the coefficient of x2 equal to 1, by
dividing by a.

Quadratic Formula

The solutions to a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0 are given by the formula:

x = −b ± b2 − 4ac

2a

To use the Quadratic Formula, we substitute the values of a, b, and c from the standard form into the expression on the
right side of the formula. Then we simplify the expression. The result is the pair of solutions to the quadratic equation.

Notice the formula is an equation. Make sure you use both sides of the equation.

Yes, the expression under the radical of the Quadratic Formula makes it easy for us to determine the number and type of
solutions. This expression is called the discriminant.

Identify the Most Appropriate Method to Use to Solve a Quadratic Equation

We summarize the four methods that we have used to solve quadratic equations below.

Methods for Solving Quadratic Equations

1. Factoring

2. Square Root Property

3. Completing the Square

4. Quadratic Formula

Given that we have four methods to use to solve a quadratic equation, how do you decide which one to use? Factoring
is often the quickest method and so we try it first. If the equation is ax2 = k or a(x − h)2 = k we use the Square Root
Property. For any other equation, it is probably best to use the Quadratic Formula. Remember, you can solve any quadratic
equation by using the Quadratic Formula, but that is not always the easiest method.

What about the method of Completing the Square? Most people find that method cumbersome and prefer not to use

it. We needed to include it in the list of methods because we completed the square in general to derive the Quadratic
Formula. You will also use the process of Completing the Square in other areas of algebra.

HOW TO : : IDENTIFY THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHOD TO SOLVE A QUADRATIC EQUATION.

Step 1.

Try Factoring first. If the quadratic factors easily, this method is very quick.

Step 2.

Try the Square Root Property next. If the equation fits the form ax2 = k or a(x − h)2 = k,
it can easily be solved by using the Square Root Property.

Step 3.

Use the Quadratic Formula. Any other quadratic equation is best solved by using the
Quadratic Formula.

The next example uses this strategy to decide how to solve each quadratic equation.

EXAMPLE 9.29

Identify the most appropriate method to use to solve each quadratic equation.

ⓐ 5z2 = 17 ⓑ 4x2 − 12x + 9 = 0 ⓒ 8u2 + 6u = 11.

ⓐ

Solution

5z2 = 17

Since the equation is in the ax2 = k,

the most appropriate method is to use the Square Root Property.

ⓑ

4x2 − 12x + 9 = 0

We recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial, and so factoring will be the most appropriate
method.

ⓒ

Put the equation in standard form.

8u2 + 6u = 11
8u2 + 6u − 11 = 0

While our first thought may be to try factoring, thinking about all the possibilities for trial and error method leads us to
choose the Quadratic Formula as the most appropriate method.

Solve Equations in Quadratic Form
Sometimes when we factored trinomials, the trinomial did not appear to be in the ax2 + bx + c form. So we factored by
substitution allowing us to make it fit the ax2 + bx + c form. We used the standard u for the substitution.
To factor the expression x4 − 4x2 − 5, we noticed the variable part of the middle term is x2 and its square, x4, is the variable

part of the first term. (We know ⎛

⎝x2⎞
⎠

2

= x4. ) So we let u = x2 and factored.

Let u = x2 and substitute.

Factor the trinomial.

Replace u with x2 .

Similarly, sometimes an equation is not in the ax2 + bx + c = 0 form but looks much like a quadratic equation. Then, we can
often make a thoughtful substitution that will allow us to make it fit the ax2 + bx + c = 0 form. If we can make it fit the form,
we can then use all of our methods to solve quadratic equations.
Notice that in the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, the middle term has a variable, x, and its square, x2, is the variable
part of the first term. Look for this relationship as you try to find a substitution.

Again, we will use the standard u to make a substitution that will put the equation in quadratic form. If the substitution
gives us an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, we say the original equation was of quadratic form.

The next example shows the steps for solving an equation in quadratic form.

Solve Applications Modeled by Quadratic Equations

We solved some applications that are modeled by quadratic equations earlier, when the only method we had to solve
them was factoring. Now that we have more methods to solve quadratic equations, we will take another look at
applications.

Let’s first summarize the methods we now have to solve quadratic equations.

Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations

1. Factoring

2. Square Root Property

3. Completing the Square

4. Quadratic Formula

As you solve each equation, choose the method that is most convenient for you to work the problem. As a reminder, we
will copy our usual Problem-Solving Strategy here so we can follow the steps.

HOW TO : : USE A PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY.

Step 1.

Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.

Step 2.

Identify what we are looking for.

Step 3.

Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

Step 4.

Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all
the important information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation.

Step 5.

Solve the equation using algebra techniques.

Step 6.

Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.

Step 7.

Answer the question with a complete sentence

We have solved number applications that involved consecutive even and odd integers, by modeling the situation with
linear equations. Remember, we noticed each even integer is 2 more than the number preceding it. If we call the first one
n, then the next one is n + 2. The next one would be n + 2 + 2 or n + 4. This is also true when we use odd integers. One set
of even integers and one set of odd integers are shown below.

Some applications of odd or even consecutive integers are modeled by quadratic equations. The notation above will be
helpful as you name the variables.

EXAMPLE 9.35

The product of two consecutive odd integers is 195. Find the integers.

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.
Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for two consecutive odd integers.
Step 3. Name what we are looking for.

Let n = the first odd integer.
n + 2 = the next odd integer

Step 4. Translate into an equation. State
the problem in one sentence.

“The product of two consecutive odd integers is 195.”

The product of the first odd integer and
the second odd integer is 195.

Translate into an equation.

Step 5. Solve the equation. Distribute.
Write the equation in standard form.
Factor.

n(n + 2) = 195
n2 + 2n = 195

n2 + 2n − 195 = 0
(n + 15)(n − 13) = 0

Use the Zero Product Property.
Solve each equation.
There are two values of n that are solutions. This will give us two pairs of consecutive odd integers
for our solution.

n + 15 = 0 n − 13 = 0
n = −15, n = 13

First odd integer n = 13
next odd integer n + 2
13 + 2

First odd integer n = −15
next odd integer n + 2

We will use the formula for the area of a triangle to solve the next example.

Area of a Triangle

For a triangle with base, b, and height, h, the area, A, is given by the formula A = 1

bh.

Recall that when we solve geometric applications, it is helpful to draw the figure.

EXAMPLE 9.36

An architect is designing the entryway of a restaurant. She wants to put a triangular window above the doorway. Due to
energy restrictions, the window can only have an area of 120 square feet and the architect wants the base to be 4 feet
more than twice the height. Find the base and height of the window.

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.
Draw a picture.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

We are looking for the base and height.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for.

Let h = the height of the triangle.
2h + 4 = the base of the triangle

Step 4. Translate into an equation.
We know the area. Write the
formula for the area of a triangle.

Step 5. Solve the equation.

h + 12 = 0

h = 10,

h = − 12

Since h is the height of a window, a value of h = −12 does not make sense.

The height of the triangle h = 10.

In the two preceding examples, the number in the radical in the Quadratic Formula was a perfect square and so the
solutions were rational numbers. If we get an irrational number as a solution to an application problem, we will use a
calculator to get an approximate value.

We will use the formula for the area of a rectangle to solve the next example.

Area of a Rectangle

For a rectangle with length, L, and width, W, the area, A, is given by the formula A = LW.

EXAMPLE 9.37

Mike wants to put 150 square feet of artificial turf in his front yard. This is the maximum area of artificial turf allowed by
his homeowners association. He wants to have a rectangular area of turf with length one foot less than 3 times the width.

The Pythagorean Theorem gives the relation between the legs and hypotenuse of a right triangle. We will use the
Pythagorean Theorem to solve the next example.

EXAMPLE 9.38

Rene is setting up a holiday light display. He wants to make a ‘tree’ in the shape of two right triangles, as shown below,
and has two 10-foot strings of lights to use for the sides. He will attach the lights to the top of a pole and to two stakes on
the ground. He wants the height of the pole to be the same as the distance from the base of the pole to each stake. How
tall should the pole be?

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem. Draw a
picture.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking
for.

We are looking for the height of the pole.

Step 3. Name what we are looking
for.

The distance from the base of the pole to either stake is the same
as the height of the pole.

Let x = the height of the pole.

x = the distance from pole to stake

Each side is a right triangle. We draw a picture of one of them.

Step 4. Translate into an equation.
We can use the Pythagorean
Theorem to solve for x.

Step 5. Solve the equation.
Substitute.

The height of a projectile shot upward from the ground is modeled by a quadratic equation. The initial velocity, v0, propels
the object up until gravity causes the object to fall back down.

Projectile motion

The height in feet, h , of an object shot upwards into the air with initial velocity, v0 , after t seconds is given by the
formula

h = −16t 2 + v0 t

We can use this formula to find how many seconds it will take for a firework to reach a specific height.

EXAMPLE 9.39

A firework is shot upwards with initial velocity 130 feet per second. How many seconds will it take to reach a height of 260
feet? Round to the nearest tenth of a second.

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.

We are looking for the number of
seconds, which is time.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for.

We have solved uniform motion problems using the formula D = rt in previous chapters. We used a table like the one
below to organize the information and lead us to the equation.

The formula D = rt assumes we know r and t and use them to find D. If we know D and r and need to find t, we would solve
the equation for t and get the formula t = D
r .

Some uniform motion problems are also modeled by quadratic equations.

EXAMPLE 9.40

Professor Smith just returned from a conference that was 2,000 miles east of his home. His total time in the airplane for
the round trip was 9 hours. If the plane was flying at a rate of 450 miles per hour, what was the speed of the jet stream?

Solution

This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation.

918

Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions

We fill in the chart to organize the information.

We are looking for the speed of the jet stream.

Let r = the speed of the jet stream.

When the plane flies with the wind, the wind increases its speed and so the rate is 450 + r.

When the plane flies against the wind, the wind decreases its speed and the rate is 450 − r.

Write in the rates.
Write in the distances.
Since D = r · t , we solve for
t and get t = D
r .
We divide the distance by
the rate in each row, and
place the expression in the
time column.

We know the times add to 9
and so we write our equation.

We multiply both sides by the LCD.

Simplify.

Factor the 2,000.

Solve.

Divide by 9.

Simplify.

Check:
Is 50 mph a reasonable speed for the
jet stream? Yes.
If the plane is traveling 450 mph and
the wind is 50 mph,
Tailwind

450 + 50 = 500 mph

Headwind

450 − 50 = 400 mph

This is a work problem. A chart will help us organize the information.

We are looking for how many hours it would take each press separately to complete the job.

Let x = the number of hours for Press #2
to complete the job.
Enter the hours per job for Press #1,
Press #2, and when they work together.

The part completed by Press #1 plus the part
completed by Press #2 equals the
amount completed together.
Translate to an equation.

Solve.

Multiply by the LCD, 8x(x + 12) .

Simplify.

Solve.

Since the idea of negative hours does not
make sense, we use the value x = 12 .

Write our sentence answer.

Press #1 would take 24 hours and
Press #2 would take 12 hours to do the job alone.

If you missed this problem, review Example 1.21.

Recognize the Graph of a Quadratic Function
Previously we very briefly looked at the function f (x) = x2 , which we called the square function. It was one of the first
non-linear functions we looked at. Now we will graph functions of the form f (x) = ax2 + bx + c if a ≠ 0. We call this
kind of function a quadratic function.

Quadratic Function

A quadratic function, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0,

is a function of the form

We graphed the quadratic function f (x) = x2 by plotting points.

f (x) = ax2 + bx + c

Every quadratic function has a graph that looks like this. We call this figure a parabola.

Let’s practice graphing a parabola by plotting a few points.

EXAMPLE 9.42

Graph f (x) = x2 − 1.

Solution

We will graph the function by plotting points.

Figure 9.2

Notice that the only difference in the two functions is the negative sign before the quadratic term (x2 in the equation of
the graph in Figure 9.2). When the quadratic term, is positive, the parabola opens upward, and when the quadratic term
is negative, the parabola opens downward.

EXAMPLE 9.43

ⓐ f (x) = −3x2 + 2x − 4 ⓑ f (x) = 6x2 + 7x − 9.

ⓑ

Since the “a” is negative, the parabola will open downward.

Determine whether the graph of each function is a parabola that opens upward or downward:

ⓐ f (x) = −2x2 − 2x − 3 ⓑ f (x) = 5x2 − 2x − 1.

Find the Axis of Symmetry and Vertex of a Parabola

Look again at Figure 9.2. Do you see that we could fold each parabola in half and then one side would lie on top of the
other? The ‘fold line’ is a line of symmetry. We call it the axis of symmetry of the parabola.

We show the same two graphs again with the axis of symmetry. See Figure 9.3.

Figure 9.3

The equation of the axis of symmetry can be derived by using the Quadratic Formula. We will omit the derivation here and
proceed directly to using the result. The equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph of f (x) = ax2 + bx + c is x = − b
2a

.

So to find the equation of symmetry of each of the parabolas we graphed above, we will substitute into the formula
x = − b
2a

.

Notice that these are the equations of the dashed blue lines on the graphs.

The point on the parabola that is the lowest (parabola opens up), or the highest (parabola opens down), lies on the axis
of symmetry. This point is called the vertex of the parabola.

We can easily find the coordinates of the vertex, because we know it is on the axis of symmetry. This means its
x-coordinate is − b
2a

. To find the y-coordinate of the vertex we substitute the value of the x-coordinate into the quadratic

function.

Axis of Symmetry and Vertex of a Parabola

The graph of the function f (x) = ax2 + bx + c is a parabola where:

•

•

•

the axis of symmetry is the vertical line x = − b
2a

.

the vertex is a point on the axis of symmetry, so its x-coordinate is − b
2a

.

the y-coordinate of the vertex is found by substituting x = − b
2a

into the quadratic equation.

EXAMPLE 9.44

For the graph of f (x) = 3x2 − 6x + 2 find:

ⓐ the axis of symmetry ⓑ the vertex.

The axis of symmetry is the vertical line
x = − b

Substitute the values of a, b into the
equation.

Simplify.

Find the Intercepts of a Parabola

When we graphed linear equations, we often used the x- and y-intercepts to help us graph the lines. Finding the
coordinates of the intercepts will help us to graph parabolas, too.

Remember, at the y-intercept the value of x is zero. So to find the y-intercept, we substitute x = 0 into the function.

Let’s find the y-intercepts of the two parabolas shown in Figure 9.4.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5

Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions

929

Figure 9.4

An x-intercept results when the value of f (x) is zero. To find an x-intercept, we let f (x) = 0. In other words, we will need to
solve the equation 0 = ax2 + bx + c for x.

f (x) = ax2 + bx + c
0 = ax2 + bx + c

Solving quadratic equations like this is exactly what we have done earlier in this chapter!

We can now find the x-intercepts of the two parabolas we looked at. First we will find the x-intercepts of the parabola
whose function is f (x) = x2 + 4x + 3.

Let f (x) = 0 .

Factor.

Use the Zero Product Property.

Solve.

The x-intercepts are (−1, 0) and (−3, 0) .

Now we will find the x-intercepts of the parabola whose function is f (x) = −x2 + 4x + 3.

930

Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions

Let f (x) = 0 .

This quadratic does not factor, so
we use the Quadratic Formula.

a = −1, b = 4, c = 3

Simplify.

The x-intercepts are ⎛

⎝2 + 7, 0⎞

⎠ and

⎛

⎝2 − 7, 0⎞
⎠ .

We will use the decimal approximations of the x-intercepts, so that we can locate these points on the graph,

⎛

⎝2 + 7, 0⎞

⎠ ≈ (4.6, 0)

⎛

⎝2 − 7, 0⎞

⎠ ≈ (−0.6, 0)

Do these results agree with our graphs? See Figure 9.5.

Find the intercepts of the parabola whose function is f (x) = x2 − 4x − 12.

In this chapter, we have been solving quadratic equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. We solved for x and the results were
the solutions to the equation.
We are now looking at quadratic functions of the form f (x) = ax2 + bx + c. The graphs of these functions are parabolas. The
x-intercepts of the parabolas occur where f (x) = 0.

For example:

Quadratic equation

x2 − 2x − 15 = 0
(x − 5)(x + 3) = 0
x − 5 = 0 x + 3 = 0

x = 5

x = −3

Let f (x) = 0.

Quadratic function
f (x) = x2 − 2x − 15
0 = x2 − 2x − 15
0 = (x − 5)(x + 3)
x − 5 = 0 x + 3 = 0

x = −3

x = 5
(5, 0) and (−3, 0)
x-intercepts

The solutions of the quadratic function are the x values of the x-intercepts.

Earlier, we saw that quadratic equations have 2, 1, or 0 solutions. The graphs below show examples of parabolas for these
three cases. Since the solutions of the functions give the x-intercepts of the graphs, the number of x-intercepts is the same
as the number of solutions.

Previously, we used the discriminant to determine the number of solutions of a quadratic function of the form
ax2 + bx + c = 0. Now we can use the discriminant to tell us how many x-intercepts there are on the graph.

Before you to find the values of the x-intercepts, you may want to evaluate the discriminant so you know how many
solutions to expect.

Solve Maximum and Minimum Applications

Knowing that the vertex of a parabola is the lowest or highest point of the parabola gives us an easy way to determine the
minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function. The y-coordinate of the vertex is the minimum value of a parabola
that opens upward. It is the maximum value of a parabola that opens downward. See Figure 9.6.

We have used the formula

h(t) = −16t 2 + v0 t + h0

to calculate the height in feet, h , of an object shot upwards into the air with initial velocity, v0, after t seconds .

This formula is a quadratic function, so its graph is a parabola. By solving for the coordinates of the vertex (t, h), we can
find how long it will take the object to reach its maximum height. Then we can calculate the maximum height.

Graph Quadratic Functions of the form f(x) = x2 + k

In the last section, we learned how to graph quadratic functions using their properties. Another method involves starting
f (x) = x2 and ‘moving’ it according to information given in the function equation. We call this

with the basic graph of

graphing quadratic functions using transformations.

In the first example, we will graph the quadratic function f (x) = x2 by plotting points. Then we will see what effect
adding a constant, k, to the equation will have on the graph of the new function f (x) = x2 + k.

functions.

Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions

The g(x) values are two more than the f(x) values. Also, the h(x) values are two less than the f(x) values. Now we will graph
all three functions on the same rectangular coordinate system.

The graph of g(x) = x2 + 2 is the same as the graph of f (x) = x2 but shifted up 2 units.

The graph of h(x) = x2 − 2 is the same as the graph of f (x) = x2 but shifted down 2 units.

ⓐ Graph f (x) = x2, g(x) = x2 + 6, and h(x) = x2 − 6 on the same rectangular coordinate system.
ⓑ Describe what effect adding a constant to the function has on the basic parabola.

The last example shows us that to graph a quadratic function of the form f (x) = x2 + k, we take the basic parabola
graph of f (x) = x2 and vertically shift it up (k > 0) or shift it down (k < 0) .

This transformation is called a vertical shift.

Graph a Quadratic Function of the form f(x) = x2 + k Using a Vertical Shift

The graph of f (x) = x2 + k shifts the graph of f (x) = x2 vertically k units.

•

•

If k > 0, shift the parabola vertically up k units.
If k < 0, shift the parabola vertically down |k| units.

Now that we have seen the effect of the constant, k, it is easy to graph functions of the form f (x) = x2 + k. We just start
with the basic parabola of f (x) = x2 and then shift it up or down.

It may be helpful to practice sketching f (x) = x2 quickly. We know the values and can sketch the graph from there.

The last example shows us that to graph a quadratic function of the form f (x) = (x − h)2, we take the basic parabola
graph of f (x) = x2 and shift it left (h > 0) or shift it right (h < 0).

This transformation is called a horizontal shift.

Graph a Quadratic Function of the form f(x) = (x − h)2 Using a Horizontal Shift

The graph of f (x) = (x − h)2 shifts the graph of f (x) = x2 horizontally h units.

If h < 0, shift the parabola horizontally right |h| units.

start with the basic parabola of f (x) = x2 and then shift it left or right.

The next example will require a horizontal shift.

Graph Quadratic Functions of the Form f(x) = ax2

So far we graphed the quadratic function f (x) = x2 and then saw the effect of including a constant h or k in the equation
had on the resulting graph of the new function. We will now explore the effect of the coefficient a on the resulting graph
of the new function f (x) = ax2.

956

Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions

If we graph these functions, we can see the effect of the constant a, assuming a > 0.

To graph a function with constant a it is easiest to choose a few points on f (x) = x2 and multiply the y-values by a.

Graph of a Quadratic Function of the form f(x) = ax2

The coefficient a in the function f (x) = ax2 affects the graph of f (x) = x2 by stretching or compressing it.

•

•

If 0 < |a| < 1,

the graph of f (x) = ax2 will be “wider” than the graph of f (x) = x2.

If |a| > 1 , the graph of f (x) = ax2 will be “skinnier” than the graph of f (x) = x2.

We will graph the functions f (x) = x2 and g(x) = 3x2 on the same grid. We will choose a few points on f (x) = x2 and
then multiply the y-values by 3 to get the points for g(x) = 3x2.

Graph Quadratic Functions Using Transformations
We have learned how the constants a, h, and k in the functions, f (x) = x2 + k,
f (x) = (x − h)2, and f (x) = ax2 affect
their graphs. We can now put this together and graph quadratic functions f (x) = ax2 + bx + c by first putting them into
the form f (x) = a(x − h)2 + k by completing the square. This form is sometimes known as the vertex form or standard
form.

We must be careful to both add and subtract the number to the SAME side of the function to complete the square. We
cannot add the number to both sides as we did when we completed the square with quadratic equations.

When we complete the square in a function with a coefficient of x2 that is not one, we have to factor that coefficient from
just the x-terms. We do not factor it from the constant term. It is often helpful to move the constant term a bit to the right
to make it easier to focus only on the x-terms.

Once we get the constant we want to complete the square, we must remember to multiply it by that coefficient before we
then subtract it.

EXAMPLE 9.59

Rewrite f (x) = −3x2 − 6x − 1 in the f (x) = a(x − h)2 + k form by completing the square.

We both add 9 and subtract 9 to not change the value of the function.

Rewrite the trinomial as a square and subtract the constants.

Looking at the h, k values, we see the graph will take the graph of

units.

We have learned how to solve linear inequalities and rational inequalities previously. Some of the techniques we used to
solve them were the same and some were different.

We will now learn to solve inequalities that have a quadratic expression. We will use some of the techniques from solving
linear and rational inequalities as well as quadratic equations.

We will solve quadratic inequalities two ways—both graphically and algebraically.

Solve Quadratic Inequalities Graphically
A quadratic equation is in standard form when written as ax2 + bx + c = 0. If we replace the equal sign with an inequality
sign, we have a quadratic inequality in standard form.

Quadratic Inequality

A quadratic inequality is an inequality that contains a quadratic expression.

The standard form of a quadratic inequality is written:

ax2 + bx + c < 0

ax2 + bx + c ≤ 0

ax2 + bx + c > 0

ax2 + bx + c ≥ 0

The graph of a quadratic function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c = 0 is a parabola. When we ask when is ax2 + bx + c < 0, we are asking
when is f(x) < 0. We want to know when the parabola is below the x-axis.
When we ask when is ax2 + bx + c > 0, we are asking when is f(x) > 0. We want to know when the parabola is above the
y-axis.

Solve Quadratic Inequalities Algebraically

The algebraic method we will use is very similar to the method we used to solve rational inequalities. We will find the
critical points for the inequality, which will be the solutions to the related quadratic equation. Remember a polynomial
expression can change signs only where the expression is zero.

We will use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals and then determine whether the quadratic
expression willl be postive or negative in the interval. We then determine the solution for the inequality.

Also, the parabola opens upward. This

Introduction

As the world population continues to grow, food supplies are becoming less able to meet the increasing demand. At the
same time, available resources of fertile soil for growing plants is dwindling. One possible solution—grow plants without
soil. Botanists around the world are expanding the potential of hydroponics, which is the process of growing plants
without soil. To provide the plants with the nutrients they need, the botanists keep careful growth records. Some growth
is described by the types of functions you will explore in this chapter—exponential and logarithmic. You will evaluate and
graph these functions, and solve equations using them.

992

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

functions are used extensively in business and the sciences as we will see.

Find and Evaluate Composite Functions

Before we introduce the functions, we need to look at another operation on functions called composition. In composition,
the output of one function is the input of a second function. For functions f and g,
the composition is written f ∘ g
and is defined by ⎛

⎝ f ∘ g⎞

⎠(x) = f ⎛

⎝g(x)⎞
⎠.

We read f ⎛

⎝g(x)⎞

⎠ as “ f of g of x.”

To do a composition, the output of the first function, g(x), becomes the input of the second function, f, and so we must
be sure that it is part of the domain of f.

Composition of Functions

The composition of functions f and g is written f · g and is defined by

We read f ⎛

⎝g(x)⎞

⎠ as f of g of x.

⎛

⎝ f ∘ g⎞

⎠(x) = f ⎛

⎝g(x)⎞

⎠

We have actually used composition without using the notation many times before. When we graphed quadratic functions
using translations, we were composing functions. For example, if we first graphed g(x) = x2 as a parabola and then
shifted it down vertically four units, we were using the composition defined by ⎛

⎝ f ∘ g⎞

⎠(x) = f ⎛

⎝g(x)⎞

⎠ where f (x) = x − 4.

The next example will demonstrate that ⎛

Determine Whether a Function is One-to-One

When we first introduced functions, we said a function is a relation that assigns to each element in its domain exactly one
element in the range. For each ordered pair in the relation, each x-value is matched with only one y-value.

We used the birthday example to help us understand the definition. Every person has a birthday, but no one has two
birthdays and it is okay for two people to share a birthday. Since each person has exactly one birthday, that relation is a
function.

A function is one-to-one if each value in the range has exactly one element in the domain. For each ordered pair in the
function, each y-value is matched with only one x-value.

Our example of the birthday relation is not a one-to-one function. Two people can share the same birthday. The range
value August 2 is the birthday of Liz and June, and so one range value has two domain values. Therefore, the function is

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

995

not one-to-one.

One-to-One Function

A function is one-to-one if each value in the range corresponds to one element in the domain. For each ordered pair
in the function, each y-value is matched with only one x-value. There are no repeated y-values.

EXAMPLE 10.3

For each set of ordered pairs, determine if it represents a function and, if so, if the function is one-to-one.

ⓐ {(−3, 27), (−2, 8), (−1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 8), (3, 27)} and ⓑ {(0, 0), (1, 1), (4, 2), (9, 3), (16, 4)}.

Solution

ⓐ

{(−3, 27), (−2, 8), (−1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 8), (3, 27)}

Each x-value is matched with only one y-value. So this relation is a function.

But each y-value is not paired with only one x-value, (−3, 27) and (3, 27),
one.

ⓑ

{(0, 0), (1, 1), (4, 2), (9, 3), (16, 4)}

Each x-value is matched with only one y-value. So this relation is a function.

Since each y-value is paired with only one x-value, this function is one-to-one.

for example. So this function is not one-to-

TRY IT : : 10.5

For each set of ordered pairs, determine if it represents a function and if so, is the function one-to-one.

ⓐ {(−3, −6), (−2, −4), (−1, −2), (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)}
ⓑ {(−4, 8), (−2, 4), (−1, 2), (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 8)}

TRY IT : : 10.6

For each set of ordered pairs, determine if it represents a function and if so, is the function one-to-one.

ⓐ {(27, −3), (8, −2), (1, −1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (8, 2), (27, 3)}
ⓑ {(7, −3), (−5, −4), (8, 0), (0, 0), (−6, 4), (−2, 2), (−1, 3)}

To help us determine whether a relation is a function, we use the vertical line test. A set of points in a rectangular
coordinate system is the graph of a function if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point. Also, if any
vertical line intersects the graph in more than one point, the graph does not represent a function.

The vertical line is representing an x-value and we check that it intersects the graph in only one y-value. Then it is a
function.

To check if a function is one-to-one, we use a similar process. We use a horizontal line and check that each horizontal line
intersects the graph in only one point. The horizontal line is representing a y-value and we check that it intersects the
graph in only one x-value. If every horizontal line intersects the graph of a function in at most one point, it is a one-to-one
function. This is the horizontal line test.

Horizontal Line Test

If every horizontal line intersects the graph of a function in at most one point, it is a one-to-one function.

We can test whether a graph of a relation is a function by using the vertical line test. We can then tell if the function is
one-to-one by applying the horizontal line test.

EXAMPLE 10.4

996

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Determine ⓐ whether each graph is the graph of a function and, if so, ⓑ whether it is one-to-one.

Solution

ⓐ

Since any vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, the graph is the graph of a function. Since any horizontal
line intersects the graph in at most one point, the graph is the graph of a one-to-one function.

ⓑ

Since any vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, the graph is the graph of a function. The horizontal line
shown on the graph intersects it in two points. This graph does not represent a one-to-one function.

Find the Inverse of a Function

Let’s look at a one-to one function,

f , represented by the ordered pairs {(0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8)}. For each x
f adds 5 to get the y -value. To ‘undo’ the addition of 5, we subtract 5 from each y -value and get back to the

-value,

original x -value. We can call this “taking the inverse of

f ” and name the function f −1.

998

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Notice that that the ordered pairs of
range of f −1 and the domain of f −1 is the range of f .

f and f −1 have their x -values and y -values reversed. The domain of

f

is the

If f (x) is a one-to-one function whose ordered pairs are of the form (x, y),

then its inverse function f −1 (x) is the

In the next example we will find the inverse of a function defined by ordered pairs.

EXAMPLE 10.5

Find the inverse of the function {(0, 3), (1, 5), (2, 7), (3, 9)}. Determine the domain and range of the inverse function.

Solution

This function is one-to-one since every x -value is paired with exactly one y -value.

To find the inverse we reverse the x -values and y -values in the ordered pairs of the function.

We just noted that if f (x) is a one-to-one function whose ordered pairs are of the form (x, y),
f −1 (x) is the set of ordered pairs (y, x).

then its inverse function

So if a point (a, b) is on the graph of a function f (x),

then the ordered pair (b, a) is on the graph of

Figure 10.2

The distance between any two pairs (a, b) and (b, a) is cut in half by the line y = x. So we say the points are mirror
images of each other through the line y = x.

Since every point on the graph of a function f (x) is a mirror image of a point on the graph of f −1 (x), we say the graphs
are mirror images of each other through the line y = x. We will use this concept to graph the inverse of a function in the
next example.

EXAMPLE 10.6

Graph, on the same coordinate system, the inverse of the one-to one function shown.

Solution

We can use points on the graph to find points on the inverse graph. Some points on the graph are:
(−5, −3), (−3, −1), (−1, 0), (0, 2), (3, 4) .

So, the inverse function will contain the points: (−3, −5), (−1, −3), (0, −1), (2, 0), (4, 3) .

Notice how the graph of the original function and the graph of the inverse functions are mirror images through the line
y = x.

Graph Exponential Functions

The functions we have studied so far do not give us a model for many naturally occurring phenomena. From the growth
of populations and the spread of viruses to radioactive decay and compounding interest, the models are very different
from what we have studied so far. These models involve exponential functions.
An exponential function is a function of the form f (x) = a x where a > 0 and a ≠ 1.

Exponential Function

An exponential function, where a > 0 and a ≠ 1,

is a function of the form

f (x) = a x

Notice that in this function, the variable is the exponent. In our functions so far, the variables were the base.

Our definition says a ≠ 1. If we let a = 1,
f (x) = 1. This is the constant function.

then f (x) = a x becomes f (x) = 1 x. Since 1 x = 1 for all real numbers,

Our definition also says a > 0. If we let a base be negative, say −4,
x = 1
2

.

then f (x) = (−4) x is not a real number when

f (x) = (−4) x

⎠ = (−4)

In fact,

f (x) = (−4) x would not be a real number any time x is a fraction with an even denominator. So our definition

requires a > 0.

By graphing a few exponential functions, we will be able to see their unique properties.

EXAMPLE 10.10

On the same coordinate system graph f (x) = 2 x and g(x) = 3 x.

Solution

We will use point plotting to graph the functions.

TRY IT : : 10.19

Graph:

f (x) = 4 x.

TRY IT : : 10.20

Graph: g(x) = 5 x.

If we look at the graphs from the previous Example and Try Its, we can identify some of the properties of exponential
functions.

The graphs of

f (x) = 2 x and g(x) = 3 x, as well as the graphs of

f (x) = 4 x and g(x) = 5 x, all have the same basic

shape. This is the shape we expect from an exponential function where a > 1.

We notice, that for each function, the graph contains the point (0, 1). This make sense because a0 = 1 for any a.
The graph of each function, f (x) = a x also contains the point (1, a). The graph of f (x) = 2 x contained (1, 2) and the
graph of g(x) = 3 x contained (1, 3). This makes sense as a1 = a.

Notice too, the graph of each function f (x) = a x also contains the point

⎛
⎝−1, 1
a

⎞
⎠. The graph of

f (x) = 2 x contained

⎛
⎝−1, 1
2

⎞
⎠ and the graph of g(x) = 3 x contained

⎛
⎝−1, 1
3

⎞
⎠. This makes sense as a−1 = 1
a.

What is the domain for each function? From the graphs we can see that the domain is the set of all real numbers. There is
no restriction on the domain. We write the domain in interval notation as (−∞, ∞).

Look at each graph. What is the range of the function? The graph never hits the x -axis. The range is all positive numbers.

1010

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

We write the range in interval notation as (0, ∞).

Whenever a graph of a function approaches a line but never touches it, we call that line an asymptote. For the exponential
functions we are looking at, the graph approaches the x -axis very closely but will never cross it, we call the line y = 0,
the x-axis, a horizontal asymptote.

Our definition of an exponential function f (x) = a x says a > 0, but the examples and discussion so far has been about
functions where a > 1. What happens when 0 < a < 1 ? The next example will explore this possibility.

the graphs go down from

We notice that for each function, the graph still contains the point (0, 1). This make sense because a0 = 1 for any a.

What is the domain and range for each function? From the graphs we can see that the domain is the set of all real

all positive numbers. We write the range in interval notation as (0, ∞).

We will summarize these properties in the chart below. Which also include when a > 1.

It is important for us to notice that both of these graphs are one-to-one, as they both pass the horizontal line test. This
means the exponential function will have an inverse. We will look at this later.

When we graphed quadratic functions, we were able to graph using translation rather than just plotting points. Will that
work in graphing exponential functions?

EXAMPLE 10.12

On the same coordinate system graph f (x) = 2 x and g(x) = 2 x + 1.

Solution

We will use point plotting to graph the functions.

1013

TRY IT : : 10.23

On the same coordinate system, graph:

f (x) = 2 x and g(x) = 2 x − 1.

TRY IT : : 10.24

On the same coordinate system, graph:

f (x) = 3 x and g(x) = 3 x + 1.

Looking at the graphs of the functions f (x) = 2 x and g(x) = 2 x + 1 in the last example, we see that adding one in the
exponent caused a horizontal shift of one unit to the left. Recognizing this pattern allows us to graph other functions with
the same pattern by translation.

Let’s now consider another situation that might be graphed more easily by translation, once we recognize the pattern.

EXAMPLE 10.13

On the same coordinate system graph f (x) = 3 x and g(x) = 3 x − 2.

Solution

We will use point plotting to graph the functions.

TRY IT : : 10.26

On the same coordinate system, graph:

f (x) = 4 x and g(x) = 4 x − 2.

Looking at the graphs of the functions f (x) = 3 x and g(x) = 3 x − 2 in the last example, we see that subtracting 2
caused a vertical shift of down two units. Notice that the horizontal asymptote also shifted down 2 units. Recognizing this
pattern allows us to graph other functions with the same pattern by translation.

All of our exponential functions have had either an integer or a rational number as the base. We will now look at an
exponential function with an irrational number as the base.

Before we can look at this exponential function, we need to define the irrational number, e. This number is used as a base
in many applications in the sciences and business that are modeled by exponential functions. The number is defined as

the value of

n

⎛
⎝1 + 1

as n gets larger and larger. We say, as n approaches infinity, or increases without bound. The table

The number e is like the number π in that we use a symbol to represent it because its decimal representation never stops
or repeats. The irrational number e is called the natural base.

The number e is defined as the value of

The exponential function whose base is e,

f (x) = e x is called the natural exponential function.

e ≈ 2.718281827...

Natural Exponential Function

The natural exponential function is an exponential function whose base is e

f (x) = e x

The domain is (−∞, ∞) and the range is (0, ∞).

Let’s graph the function f (x) = e x on the same coordinate system as g(x) = 2 x and h(x) = 3 x.

Notice that the graph of

f (x) = e x is “between” the graphs of g(x) = 2 x and h(x) = 3 x. Does this make sense as

2 < e < 3 ?

Solve Exponential Equations
Equations that include an exponential expression a x are called exponential equations. To solve them we use a property
if a x = a y then it is true that x = y. In other words, in an exponential equation,
that says as long as a > 0 and a ≠ 1,
if the bases are equal then the exponents are equal.

One-to-One Property of Exponential Equations

For a > 0 and a ≠ 1,

If a x = a y, then x = y.

To use this property, we must be certain that both sides of the equation are written with the same base.

Use Exponential Models in Applications

Exponential functions model many situations. If you own a bank account, you have experienced the use of an exponential
function. There are two formulas that are used to determine the balance in the account when interest is earned. If
a principal, P, is invested at an interest rate, r, for t years, the new balance, A, will depend on how often the interest
is compounded. If the interest is compounded n times a year we use the formula A = P⎛
compounded continuously, we use the formula A = Pert. These are the formulas for compound interest.

. If the interest is

A = P⎛

⎞
⎠

A = Pert

when compounded n times a year.

when compounded continuously.

As you work with the Interest formulas, it is often helpful to identify the values of the variables first and then substitute
them into the formula.

EXAMPLE 10.16

A total of $10,000 was invested in a college fund for a new grandchild. If the interest rate is 5%, how much will be in
the account in 18 years by each method of compounding?

Other topics that are modeled by exponential functions involve growth and decay. Both also use the formula A = Pert
we used for the growth of money. For growth and decay, generally we use A0, as the original amount instead of calling
the principal. We see that exponential growth has a positive rate of growth and exponential decay has a negative
it P,
rate of growth.

Exponential Growth and Decay

For an original amount, A0,

that grows or decays at a rate, r, for a certain time, t, the final amount, A, is:

A = A0 ert
Exponential growth is typically seen in the growth of populations of humans or animals or bacteria. Our next example
looks at the growth of a virus.

EXAMPLE 10.17

Chris is a researcher at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and he is trying to understand the behavior of a
new and dangerous virus. He starts his experiment with 100 of the virus that grows at a rate of 25% per hour. He will check
on the virus in 24 hours. How many viruses will he find?

Solution

Identify the values of each variable in the formulas.
Be sure to put the percent in decimal form.
Be sure the units match—the rate is per hour and
the time is in hours.

A = ?
A0 = 100

r = 0.25/hour
t = 24 hours

Substitute the values in the formula: A = A0 ert.
Compute the amount.
Round to the nearest whole virus.

A = 100e0.25 · 24
A = 40,342.88
A = 40,343

viruses.

10.3 Evaluate and Graph Logarithmic Functions

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Convert between exponential and logarithmic form
Evaluate logarithmic functions
Graph Logarithmic functions
Solve logarithmic equations
Use logarithmic models in applications

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Solve: x2 = 81.

If you missed this problem, review Example 6.46.

2. Evaluate: 3−2.

If you missed this problem, review Example 5.15.

3. Solve: 24 = 3x − 5.

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.2.

We have spent some time finding the inverse of many functions. It works well to ‘undo’ an operation with another
operation. Subtracting ‘undoes’ addition, multiplication ‘undoes’ division, taking the square root ‘undoes’ squaring.

As we studied the exponential function, we saw that it is one-to-one as its graphs pass the horizontal line test. This means
an exponential function does have an inverse. If we try our algebraic method for finding an inverse, we run into a problem.

Rewrite with y = f (x).
Interchange the variables x and y.
Solve for y.

f (x) = a x
y = a x
x = a y

Oops! We have no way to solve for y !

To deal with this we define the logarithm function with base a to be the inverse of the exponential function f (x) = a x.
We use the notation f −1 (x) = loga x and say the inverse function of the exponential function is the logarithmic function.

Logarithmic Function

The function f (x) = loga x is the logarithmic function with base a , where a > 0, x > 0, and a ≠ 1.

y = loga x is equivalent to x = a y

Convert Between Exponential and Logarithmic Form
Since the equations y = loga x and x = a y are equivalent, we can go back and forth between them. This will often be
the method to solve some exponential and logarithmic equations. To help with converting back and forth let’s take a close
look at the equations. See Figure 10.3. Notice the positions of the exponent and base.

Figure 10.3

If we realize the logarithm is the exponent it makes the conversion easier. You may want to repeat, “base to the exponent
give us the number.”

Graph Logarithmic Functions

To graph a logarithmic function y = loga x,
Generally, when we look for ordered pairs for the graph of a function, we usually choose an x-value and then determine
its corresponding y-value. In this case you may find it easier to choose y-values and then determine its corresponding
x-value.

The graphs of y = log2 x, y = log3 x, and y = log5 x are the shape we expect from a logarithmic function where
a > 1.

We notice that for each function the graph contains the point (1, 0). This make sense because 0 = loga 1 means
a0 = 1 which is true for any a.
The graph of each function, also contains the point (a, 1). This makes sense as 1 = loga a means a1 = a. which is true
for any a.

domain in interval notation as (0, ∞).

What is the range for each function? From the graphs we can see that the range is the set of all real numbers. There is no
restriction on the range. We write the range in interval notation as (−∞, ∞).

Notice how the graphs are reflections of each other through the line y = x. We know this is true of inverse functions.
Keeping a visual in your mind of these graphs will help you remember the domain and range of each function. Notice the
x-axis is the horizontal asymptote for the exponential functions and the y-axis is the vertical asymptote for the logarithmic
functions.

Solve Logarithmic Equations

When we talked about exponential functions, we introduced the number e. Just as e was a base for an exponential
function, it can be used a base for logarithmic functions too. The logarithmic function with base e is called the natural
logarithmic function. The function f (x) = loge x is generally written f (x) = ln x and we read it as “el en of x.”

Natural Logarithmic Function

The function f (x) = ln x is the natural logarithmic function with base e, where x > 0.

y = ln x is equivalent to x = e y

When the base of the logarithm function is 10, we call it the common logarithmic function and the base is not shown. If
the base a of a logarithm is not shown, we assume it is 10.

Common Logarithmic Function

The function f (x) = log x is the common logarithmic function with base 10 , where x > 0.

y = log x is equivalent to x = 10 y

To solve logarithmic equations, one strategy is to change the equation to exponential form and then solve the exponential
equation as we did before. As we solve logarithmic equations, y = loga x , we need to remember that for the base a,
a > 0 and a ≠ 1. Also, the domain is x > 0. Just as with radical equations, we must check our solutions to eliminate
any extraneous solutions.

Use Logarithmic Models in Applications

There are many applications that are modeled by logarithmic equations. We will first look at the logarithmic equation that
gives the decibel (dB) level of sound. Decibels range from 0, which is barely audible to 160, which can rupture an eardrum.
The 10−12 in the formula represents the intensity of sound that is barely audible.

Decibel Level of Sound

The magnitude R of an earthquake is measured by a logarithmic scale called the Richter scale. The model is R = log I,
where I is the intensity of the shock wave. This model provides a way to measure earthquake intensity.

Earthquake Intensity

The magnitude R of an earthquake is measured by R = log I, where I is the intensity of its shock wave.

EXAMPLE 10.27

In 1906, San Francisco experienced an intense earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale. Over 80% of the
city was destroyed by the resulting fires. In 2014, Los Angeles experienced a moderate earthquake that measured 5.1 on
the Richter scale and caused $108 million dollars of damage. Compare the intensities of the two earthquakes.

Solution

To compare the intensities, we first need to convert the magnitudes to intensities using the log formula. Then we will set
up a ratio to compare the intensities.

Convert the magnitudes to intensities.

Use the Properties of Logarithms

Now that we have learned about exponential and logarithmic functions, we can introduce some of the properties of
logarithms. These will be very helpful as we continue to solve both exponential and logarithmic equations.
The first two properties derive from the definition of logarithms. Since a0 = 1, we can convert this to logarithmic form
and get loga 1 = 0. Also, since a1 = a, we get loga a = 1.

Properties of Logarithms

loga 1 = 0

loga a = 1

In the next example we could evaluate the logarithm by converting to exponential form, as we have done previously, but
recognizing and then applying the properties saves time.

EXAMPLE 10.28

Evaluate using the properties of logarithms: ⓐ log8 1 and ⓑ log6 6.

The next two properties can also be verified by converting them from exponential form to logarithmic form, or the
reverse.

The exponential equation a

loga x

= x converts to the logarithmic equation loga x = loga x, which is a true statement

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

1039

for positive values for x only.
The logarithmic equation loga a x = x converts to the exponential equation a x = a x, which is also a true statement.

These two properties are called inverse properties because, when we have the same base, raising to a power “undoes” the
log and taking the log “undoes” raising to a power. These two properties show the composition of functions. Both ended
up with the identity function which shows again that the exponential and logarithmic functions are inverse functions.

Inverse Properties of Logarithms

For a > 0, x > 0 and a ≠ 1,

loga x

a

= x

loga a x = x

In the next example, apply the inverse properties of logarithms.

There are three more properties of logarithms that will be useful in our work. We know exponential functions and
logarithmic function are very interrelated. Our definition of logarithm shows us that a logarithm is the exponent of the
equivalent exponential. The properties of exponents have related properties for exponents.
In the Product Property of Exponents, am · an = am + n, we see that to multiply the same base, we add the exponents.
The Product Property of Logarithms, loga M · N = loga M + loga N tells us to take the log of a product, we add the
log of the factors.

Product Property of Logarithms

If M > 0, N > 0, a > 0 and a ≠ 1,

then,

The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms.

We use this property to write the log of a product as a sum of the logs of each factor.

loga (M · N) = loga M + loga N

EXAMPLE 10.30

Use the Product Property of Logarithms to write each logarithm as a sum of logarithms. Simplify, if possible: ⓐ log3 7x
and ⓑ log4 64xy.

Similarly, in the Quotient Property of Exponents, am

exponents. The Quotient Property of Logarithms, loga

an = am − n, we see that to divide the same base, we subtract the
= loga M − loga N tells us to take the log of a quotient, we

M
N

subtract the log of the numerator and denominator.

Quotient Property of Logarithms

If M > 0, N > 0,a > 0 and a ≠ 1,

then,

loga

M
N

= loga M − loga N

The logarithm of a quotient is the difference of the logarithms.

Note that loga M − loga N ≠ loga(M − N).

We use this property to write the log of a quotient as a difference of the logs of each factor.

The third property of logarithms is related to the Power Property of Exponents, (am)n = am · n, we see that to raise a
power to a power, we multiply the exponents. The Power Property of Logarithms, loga M p = p loga M tells us to take
the log of a number raised to a power, we multiply the power times the log of the number.

Power Property of Logarithms

If M > 0, a > 0, a ≠ 1 and p is any real number then,

loga M p = p loga M

The log of a number raised to a power as the product product of the power times the log of the number.

We use this property to write the log of a number raised to a power as the product of the power times the log of the
number. We essentially take the exponent and throw it in front of the logarithm.

Now that we have the properties we can use them to “expand” a logarithmic expression. This means to write the
logarithm as a sum or difference and without any powers.

We generally apply the Product and Quotient Properties before we apply the Power Property.

The opposite of expanding a logarithm is to condense a sum or difference of logarithms that have the same base into a
single logarithm. We again use the properties of logarithms to help us, but in reverse.

To condense logarithmic expressions with the same base into one logarithm, we start by using the Power Property to get
the coefficients of the log terms to be one and then the Product and Quotient Properties as needed.

EXAMPLE 10.35

Use the Properties of Logarithms to condense the logarithm log4 3 + log4 x − log4 y . Simplify, if possible.

Solution

The log expressions all have the same base, 4.
The first two terms are added, so we use the Product Property,
loga M + loga N = loga M · N.
Since the logs are subtracted, we use the Quotient Property,
loga M − loga N = loga

Use the Change-of-Base Formula

To evaluate a logarithm with any other base, we can use the Change-of-Base Formula. We will show how this is derived.

Suppose we want to evaluate loga M.
Let y = loga M.
Rewrite the expression in exponential form.
Take the logb of each side.
Use the Power Property.

Solve for y.

Substitute y = loga M.

loga M

y = loga M
a y = M
logb a y = logb M
ylogb a = logb M
logb M
logb a
logb M
logb a

loga M =

y =

The Change-of-Base Formula introduces a new base b. This can be any base b we want where b > 0, b ≠ 1. Because
our calculators have keys for logarithms base 10 and base e, we will rewrite the Change-of-Base Formula with the new
base as 10 or e.

Change-of-Base Formula

For any logarithmic bases a, b and M > 0,

loga M =

logb M
logb a

loga M =

loga M = ln M

new base b

new base 10

new base e

When we use a calculator to find the logarithm value, we usually round to three decimal places. This gives us an
approximate value and so we use the approximately equal symbol (≈) .

Solve Logarithmic Equations Using the Properties of Logarithms

In the section on logarithmic functions, we solved some equations by rewriting the equation in exponential form. Now
that we have the properties of logarithms, we have additional methods we can use to solve logarithmic equations.

If our equation has two logarithms we can use a property that says that if loga M = loga N then it is true that M = N.
This is the One-to-One Property of Logarithmic Equations.

One-to-One Property of Logarithmic Equations

For M > 0, N > 0, a>0, and a ≠ 1 is any real number:

If loga M = loga N, then M = N.

To use this property, we must be certain that both sides of the equation are written with the same base.

Remember that logarithms are defined only for positive real numbers. Check your results in the original equation. You
may have obtained a result that gives a logarithm of zero or a negative number.

EXAMPLE 10.38

Solve: 2log5 x = log5 81.

Solution

Use the Power Property.

Use the One-to-One Property, if loga M = loga N,
then M = N.
Solve using the Square Root Property.
We eliminate x = −9 as we cannot take the logarithm
of a negative number.
Check.

2 log5 x = log5 81

Another strategy to use to solve logarithmic equations is to condense sums or differences into a single logarithm.

EXAMPLE 10.39

Solve: log3 x + log3 (x − 8) = 2.

Solution

Use the Product Property, loga M + loga N = loga M ⋅ N.

log3 x + log3 (x − 8) = 2
log3 x(x − 8) = 2

32 = x(x − 8)
9 = x2 − 8x
0 = x2 − 8x − 9
0 = (x − 9)(x + 1)
x + 1 = 0

x − 9 = 0,

x = 9,

x = −1

Rewrite in exponential form.

Subtract 9 from each side.

Solve Exponential Equations Using Logarithms

In the section on exponential functions, we solved some equations by writing both sides of the equation with the same
base. Next we wrote a new equation by setting the exponents equal.

It is not always possible or convenient to write the expressions with the same base. In that case we often take the common
logarithm or natural logarithm of both sides once the exponential is isolated.

EXAMPLE 10.41

Solve 5 x = 11. Find the exact answer and then approximate it to three decimal places.

Solution

Since the exponential is isolated, take the logarithm of both sides.
Use the Power Property to get the x as a factor, not an exponent.

Solve for x. Find the exact answer.

Approximate the answer.
Since 51 = 5 and 52 = 25, does it makes sense that 51.490 ≈ 11 ?

Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

TRY IT : : 10.82

Solve 8 x = 98. Find the exact answer and then approximate it to three decimal places.

When we take the logarithm of both sides we will get the same result whether we use the common or the natural
logarithm (try using the natural log in the last example. Did you get the same result?) When the exponential has base e,
we use the natural logarithm.

EXAMPLE 10.42

Solve 3e x + 2 = 24. Find the exact answer and then approximate it to three decimal places.

Solution

Isolate the exponential by dividing both sides by 3.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides.
Use the Power Property to get the x as a factor, not an exponent.
Use the property ln e = 1 to simplify.
Solve the equation. Find the exact answer.
Approximate the answer.

3e x + 2 = 24
e x + 2 = 8
ln e x + 2 = ln8
(x + 2)ln e = ln8
x + 2 = ln8

Use Exponential Models in Applications

In previous sections we were able to solve some applications that were modeled with exponential equations. Now that we
have so many more options to solve these equations, we are able to solve more applications.

We will again use the Compound Interest Formulas and so we list them here for reference.

Compound Interest

For a principal, P, invested at an interest rate, r, for t years, the new balance, A is:

A = P⎛

⎝1 + r
n

⎞
⎠

nt

A = Pert

when compounded n times a year.

when compounded continuously.

EXAMPLE 10.43

Jermael’s parents put $10,000 in investments for his college expenses on his first birthday. They hope the investments will
be worth $50,000 when he turns 18. If the interest compounds continuously, approximately what rate of growth will they
need to achieve their goal?

Solution

Substitute the values into the formula.

Solve for r.Divide each side by 10,000.

Take the natural log of each side.
Use the Power Property.

Divide each side by 17.

Approximate the answer.
Convert to a percentage.

r ≈ 0.095
r ≈ 9.5%

They need the rate of growth to be approximately 9.5%.

TRY IT : : 10.86

Rachel invests $15,000 at age 25. She hopes the investments will be worth $90,000 when she turns 40. If the
interest compounds continuously, approximately what rate of growth will she need to achieve her goal?

We have seen that growth and decay are modeled by exponential functions. For growth and decay we use the formula
A = A0 ekt. Exponential growth has a positive rate of growth or growth constant, k , and exponential decay has a
negative rate of growth or decay constant, k.

Exponential Growth and Decay

For an original amount, A0,

that grows or decays at a rate, k, for a certain time, t, the final amount, A, is:

A = A0 ekt
We can now solve applications that give us enough information to determine the rate of growth. We can then use that
rate of growth to predict other situations.

EXAMPLE 10.44

Researchers recorded that a certain bacteria population grew from 100 to 300 in 3 hours. At this rate of growth, how many
bacteria will there be 24 hours from the start of the experiment?

Solution

This problem requires two main steps. First we must find the unknown rate, k. Then we use that value of k to help us find
the unknown number of bacteria.

At this rate of growth, they can expect 656,100 bacteria.

how many bacteria will there be 24 hours from the start of the experiment?

TRY IT : : 10.88

Researchers recorded that a certain bacteria population declined from 700,000 to 400,000 in 5 hours after the
administration of medication. At this rate of decay, how many bacteria will there be 24 hours from the start of the
experiment?

Radioactive substances decay or decompose according to the exponential decay formula. The amount of time it takes for
the substance to decay to half of its original amount is called the half-life of the substance.

Similar to the previous example, we can use the given information to determine the constant of decay, and then use that
constant to answer other questions.

EXAMPLE 10.45

The half-life of radium-226 is 1,590 years. How much of a 100 mg sample will be left in 500 years?

Solution

This problem requires two main steps. First we must find the decay constant k. If we start with 100-mg, at the half-life
there will be 50-mg remaining. We will use this information to find k. Then we use that value of k to help us find the
amount of sample that will be left in 500 years.

The function f (x) = loga x is the logarithmic function with base a, where a > 0, x > 0, and

a ≠ 1.

y = loga x is equivalent to x = a y

natural base

The number e is defined as the value of

n

⎛
⎝1 + 1
n

⎞
⎠

without bound, e ≈ 2.718281827...

, as n gets larger and larger. We say, as n increases

natural exponential function

The natural exponential function is an exponential function whose base is e:

f (x) = e x.

The domain is (−∞, ∞) and the range is (0, ∞).

natural logarithmic function

The function f (x) = ln x is the natural logarithmic function with base e, where x > 0.

y = ln x is equivalent to x = e y

one-to-one function

A function is one-to-one if each value in the range has exactly one element in the domain. For each

ordered pair in the function, each y-value is matched with only one x-value.

KEY CONCEPTS

10.1 Finding Composite and Inverse Functions

• Composition of Functions: The composition of functions f and g,

is written f ∘ g and is defined by

⎛

⎝ f ∘ g⎞

⎠(x) = f ⎛

⎝g(x)⎞

⎠

We read f ⎛

⎝g(x)⎞

⎠ as f of g of x.

• Horizontal Line Test: If every horizontal line, intersects the graph of a function in at most one point, it is a one-

to-one function.

•

Inverse of a Function Defined by Ordered Pairs: If f (x) is a one-to-one function whose ordered pairs are of the

form (x, y),

then its inverse function f −1 (x) is the set of ordered pairs (y, x).

•

Inverse Functions: For every x in the domain of one-to-one function f and f −1,

f −1 ⎛
⎝ f (x)⎞
⎠ = x
⎞
⎛
⎝ f −1 (x)
⎠ = x
f

• How to Find the Inverse of a One-to-One Function:

Step 1.

Substitute y for f (x).

Step 2.

Interchange the variables x and y.

Step 3.

Solve for y.

Step 4.

Substitute f −1 (x) for y.

Step 5.

Verify that the functions are inverses.

11.5 Solve Systems of Nonlinear Equations

Introduction

Five, Four. Three. Two. One. Lift off. The rocket launches off the ground headed toward space. Unmanned spaceships,
and spaceships in general, are designed by aerospace engineers. These engineers are investigating reusable rockets that
return safely to Earth to be used again. Someday, rockets may carry passengers to the International Space Station and
beyond. One essential math concept for aerospace engineers is that of conics. In this chapter, you will learn about conics,
including circles, parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Then you will use what you learn to investigate systems of nonlinear
equations.

11.1 Distance and Midpoint Formulas; Circles

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Use the Distance Formula
Use the Midpoint Formula
Write the equation of a circle in standard form
Graph a circle

Be Prepared!

Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

1. Find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are 12 and 16 inches.

If you missed this problem, review Example 2.34.

2. Factor: x2 − 18x + 81.

If you missed this problem, review Example 6.24.

3. Solve by completing the square: x2 − 12x − 12 = 0.
If you missed this problem, review Example 9.22.

In this chapter we will be looking at the conic sections, usually called the conics, and their properties. The conics are curves

1072

Chapter 11 Conics

that result from a plane intersecting a double cone—two cones placed point-to-point. Each half of a double cone is called
a nappe.

There are four conics—the circle, parabola, ellipse, and hyperbola. The next figure shows how the plane intersecting the
double cone results in each curve.

Each of the curves has many applications that affect your daily life, from your cell phone to acoustics and navigation
systems. In this section we will look at the properties of a circle.

Use the Distance Formula

We have used the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. Here we will use this theorem
again to find distances on the rectangular coordinate system. By finding distance on the rectangular coordinate system,
we can make a connection between the geometry of a conic and algebra—which opens up a world of opportunities for
application.

Our first step is to develop a formula to find distances between points on the rectangular coordinate system. We will plot
the points and create a right triangle much as we did when we found slope in Graphs and Functions. We then take it one
step further and use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle—which is the distance
between the points.

EXAMPLE 11.1

Use the rectangular coordinate system to find the distance between the points (6, 4) and (2, 1).

Solution

Plot the two points. Connect the two points
with a line.
Draw a right triangle as if you were going to
find slope.

Find the length of each leg.

Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find d, the
distance between the two points.

Substitute in the values.

32 + 42 = d 2

9 + 16 = d 2

d = 5

d = −5

Since distance, d is positive, we can eliminate
d = −5.

The distance between the points (6, 4) and
(2, 1) is 5.

Use the rectangular coordinate system to find the distance between the points (6, 1) and (2, −2).

Use the rectangular coordinate system to find the distance between the points (5, 3) and (−3, −3).

The method we used in the last example leads us to the formula to find the distance between the two points (x1, y1)
and (x2, y2).

When we found the length of the horizontal leg we subtracted 6 − 2 which is x2 − x1.

When we found the length of the vertical leg we subtracted 4 − 1 which is y2 − y1.

If the triangle had been in a different position, we may have subtracted x1 − x2 or y1 − y2. The expressions x2 − x1
and x1 − x2 vary only in the sign of the resulting number. To get the positive value-since distance is positive- we can use
absolute value. So to generalize we will say |x2 − x1| and |y2 − y1|.
In the Pythagorean Theorem, we substitute the general expressions |x2 − x1| and |y2 − y1| rather than the numbers.

Substitute in the values.
Squaring the expressions makes them
positive, so we eliminate the absolute value
bars.

Use the Square Root Property.
Distance is positive, so eliminate the negative
value.

Use the Midpoint Formula

It is often useful to be able to find the midpoint of a segment. For example, if you have the endpoints of the diameter of
a circle, you may want to find the center of the circle which is the midpoint of the diameter. To find the midpoint of a line
segment, we find the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the endpoints.

Midpoint Formula

The midpoint of the line segment whose endpoints are the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is

which formula requires addition and which subtraction of the coordinates. If we remember where the formulas come
from, is may be easier to remember the formulas.

Write the Equation of a Circle in Standard Form

As we mentioned, our goal is to connect the geometry of a conic with algebra. By using the coordinate plane, we are able
to do this easily.

We define a circle as all points in a plane that are a fixed distance from a given point in the plane. The given point is called
the center, (h, k), and the fixed distance is called the radius, r, of the circle.

Graph Horizontal Parabolas

Our work so far has only dealt with parabolas that open up or down. We are now going to look at horizontal parabolas.
These parabolas open either to the left or to the right. If we interchange the x and y in our previous equations for
parabolas, we get the equations for the parabolas that open to the left or to the right.

The graphs show what the parabolas look like when they to the left or to the right. Their position in relation to the x- or
y-axis is merely an example.

Looking at these parabolas, do their graphs represent a function? Since both graphs would fail the vertical line test, they
do not represent a function.

To graph a parabola that opens to the left or to the right is basically the same as what we did for parabolas that open up
or down, with the reversal of the x and y variables.

Solve Applications with Parabolas

Many architectural designs incorporate parabolas. It is not uncommon for bridges to be constructed using parabolas as
we will see in the next example.

EXAMPLE 11.19

Find the equation of the parabolic arch formed in the foundation of the bridge shown. Write the equation in standard
form.

Solution

We will first set up a coordinate system and draw the parabola. The graph will give us the information we need to write
the equation of the graph in the standard form y = a(x − h)2 + k.

1101

Let the lower left side of the bridge be the
origin of the coordinate grid at the point
(0, 0).
Since the base is 20 feet wide the point
(20, 0) represents the lower right side.
The bridge is 10 feet high at the highest
point. The highest point is the vertex of
the parabola so the y-coordinate of the
vertex will be 10.
Since the bridge is symmetric, the vertex
must fall halfway between the left most
point, (0, 0), and the rightmost point
(20, 0). From this we know that the
x-coordinate of the vertex will also be 10.

Identify the vertex, (h, k).

Substitute the values into the standard
form.

The value of a is still unknown. To find
the value of a use one of the other points
on the parabola.

Substitute the values of the other point
into the equation.

Graph an Ellipse with Center at the Origin

The next conic section we will look at is an ellipse. We define an ellipse as all points in a plane where the sum of the
distances from two fixed points is constant. Each of the given points is called a focus of the ellipse.

Ellipse

An ellipse is all points in a plane where the sum of the distances from two fixed points is constant. Each of the fixed
points is called a focus of the ellipse.

We can draw an ellipse by taking some fixed length of flexible string and attaching the ends to two thumbtacks. We use a
pen to pull the string taut and rotate it around the two thumbtacks. The figure that results is an ellipse.

A line drawn through the foci intersect the ellipse in two points. Each point is called a vertex of the ellipse. The segment
connecting the vertices is called the major axis. The midpoint of the segment is called the center of the ellipse. A segment
perpendicular to the major axis that passes through the center and intersects the ellipse in two points is called the minor
axis.

1108

Chapter 11 Conics

We mentioned earlier that our goal is to connect the geometry of a conic with algebra. Placing the ellipse on a rectangular
⎠ are on the
coordinate system gives us that opportunity. In the figure, we placed the ellipse so the foci

⎛

⎝(−c, 0), (c, 0)⎞

x-axis and the center is the origin.

The definition states the sum of the distance from the foci to a point (x, y) is constant. So d1 + d2 is a constant that we
will call 2a so, d1 + d2 = 2a. We will use the distance formula to lead us to an algebraic formula for an ellipse.

d1

+

d2

= 2a

Use the distance formula to find d1, d2.

After eliminating radicals and simplifying,
we get:
To simplify the equation of the ellipse, we
let a2 − c2 = b2.
So, the equation of an ellipse centered at the
origin in standard form is:

⎛

⎝x − (−c)⎞

an equation for the elliptical orbit of Pluto.

Solution

We recognize this as an ellipse that is centered at the
origin.
Since the major axis is horizontal and the distance from
the center to the vertex is 40, we know a = 40 and so
a2 = 1600.
The minor axis is vertical but the end points aren’t given.
To find b we will use the location of the Sun. Since the
Sun is a focus of the ellipse at the point (10, 0), we know
c = 10. Use this to solve for b2.

Graph a Hyperbola with Center at (0, 0)

The last conic section we will look at is called a hyperbola. We will see that the equation of a hyperbola looks the same as
the equation of an ellipse, except it is a difference rather than a sum. While the equations of an ellipse and a hyperbola
are very similar, their graphs are very different.

We define a hyperbola as all points in a plane where the difference of their distances from two fixed points is constant.
Each of the fixed points is called a focus of the hyperbola.

Hyperbola

A hyperbola is all points in a plane where the difference of their distances from two fixed points is constant. Each of
the fixed points is called a focus of the hyperbola.

The line through the foci, is called the transverse axis. The two points where the transverse axis intersects the hyperbola
are each a vertex of the hyperbola. The midpoint of the segment joining the foci is called the center of the hyperbola.
The line perpendicular to the transverse axis that passes through the center is called the conjugate axis. Each piece of
the graph is called a branch of the hyperbola.

Again our goal is to connect the geometry of a conic with algebra. Placing the hyperbola on a rectangular coordinate
system gives us that opportunity. In the figure, we placed the hyperbola so the foci ⎛
⎠ are on the x-axis and

⎝(−c, 0), (c, 0)⎞

the center is the origin.

The definition states the difference of the distance from the foci to a point (x, y) is constant. So |d1 − d2|

|d1

⎝y − 0⎞

⎠

Use the distance formula to find d1, d2

Eliminate the radicals.
To simplify the equation of the ellipse, we
let c2 − a2 = b2.
So, the equation of a hyperbola centered at
the origin in standard form is:

There are no y-intercepts.

The a, b values in the equation also help us find the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The asymptotes are intersecting straight
lines that the branches of the graph approach but never intersect as the x, y values get larger and larger.

Chapter 11 Conics

To find the asymptotes, we sketch a rectangle whose sides intersect the x-axis at the vertices (−a, 0),

There are two equations for hyperbolas, depending whether the transverse axis is vertical or horizontal. We can tell
whether the transverse axis is horizontal by looking at the equation. When the equation is in standard form, if the x2-term
is positive, the transverse axis is horizontal. When the equation is in standard form, if the y2-term is positive, the transverse
axis is vertical.

The second equations could be derived similarly to what we have done. We will summarize the results here.

Notice that, unlike the equation of an ellipse, the denominator of x2 is not always a2 and the denominator of y2 is
not always b2.
Notice that when the x2 -term is positive, the transverse axis is on the x-axis. When the y2 -term is positive, the
transverse axis is on the y-axis.

Identify Conic Sections by their Equations

Now that we have completed our study of the conic sections, we will take a look at the different equations and recognize
some ways to identify a conic by its equation. When we are given an equation to graph, it is helpful to identify the conic
so we know what next steps to take.

To identify a conic from its equation, it is easier if we put the variable terms on one side of the equation and the constants
on the other.

Solve a System of Nonlinear Equations Using Graphing

We learned how to solve systems of linear equations with two variables by graphing, substitution and elimination. We
will be using these same methods as we look at nonlinear systems of equations with two equations and two variables. A
system of nonlinear equations is a system where at least one of the equations is not linear.

For example each of the following systems is a system of nonlinear equations.

⎧
x2 + y2 = 9

x2 − y = 9

System of Nonlinear Equations

A system of nonlinear equations is a system where at least one of the equations is not linear.

Just as with systems of linear equations, a solution of a nonlinear system is an ordered pair that makes both equations
true. In a nonlinear system, there may be more than one solution. We will see this as we solve a system of nonlinear
equations by graphing.

When we solved systems of linear equations, the solution of the system was the point of intersection of the two lines. With
systems of nonlinear equations, the graphs may be circles, parabolas or hyperbolas and there may be several points of
intersection, and so several solutions. Once you identify the graphs, visualize the different ways the graphs could intersect
and so how many solutions there might be.

To solve systems of nonlinear equations by graphing, we use basically the same steps as with systems of linear equations
modified slightly for nonlinear equations. The steps are listed below for reference.

Solve a System of Nonlinear Equations Using Elimination

When we studied systems of linear equations, we used the method of elimination to solve the system. We can also use
elimination to solve systems of nonlinear equations. It works well when the equations have both variables squared. When
using elimination, we try to make the coefficients of one variable to be opposites, so when we add the equations together,
that variable is eliminated.

The elimination method is very similar to the elimination method that we used for systems of linear equations. The steps
are listed for reference.

HOW TO : : SOLVE A SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS BY ELIMINATION.

Step 1.

Identify the graph of each equation. Sketch the possible options for intersection.

Step 2.

Write both equations in standard form.

Step 3.

Make the coefficients of one variable opposites.
Decide which variable you will eliminate.
Multiply one or both equations so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.

Step 4.

Add the equations resulting from Step 3 to eliminate one variable.

Step 5.

Solve for the remaining variable.

Step 6.

Substitute each solution from Step 5 into one of the original equations. Then solve for the
other variable.

Step 7.

Write each solution as an ordered pair.

Step 8.

Check that each ordered pair is a solution to both original equations.

KEY TERMS

circle

A circle is all points in a plane that are a fixed distance from a fixed point in the plane.

ellipse

An ellipse is all points in a plane where the sum of the distances from two fixed points is constant.

hyperbola

A hyperbola is defined as all points in a plane where the difference of their distances from two fixed points is

constant.

linear.

KEY CONCEPTS

11.1 Distance and Midpoint Formulas; Circles

• Distance Formula: The distance d between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is

d = (x2 − x1)2 + (y2 − y1)2

is

⎛
⎝

x1 + x2
2

,

y1 + y2

⎞
⎠

To find the midpoint of a line segment, we find the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the
y-coordinates of the endpoints.

• Circle: A circle is all points in a plane that are a fixed distance from a fixed point in the plane. The given point is

called the center, (h, k), and the fixed distance is called the radius, r, of the circle.

11.3 Ellipses

• Ellipse: An ellipse is all points in a plane where the sum of the distances from two fixed points is constant. Each

of the fixed points is called a focus of the ellipse.

If we draw a line through the foci intersects the ellipse in two points—each is called a vertex of the ellipse.
The segment connecting the vertices is called the major axis.
The midpoint of the segment is called the center of the ellipse.
A segment perpendicular to the major axis that passes through the center and intersects the ellipse in two points
is called the minor axis.

• Hyperbola: A hyperbola is all points in a plane where the difference of their distances from two fixed points is

constant.

Each of the fixed points is called a focus of the hyperbola.
The line through the foci, is called the transverse axis.
The two points where the transverse axis intersects the hyperbola are each a vertex of the hyperbola.
The midpoint of the segment joining the foci is called the center of the hyperbola.
The line perpendicular to the transverse axis that passes through the center is called the conjugate axis.
Each piece of the graph is called a branch of the hyperbola.

Introduction

A strange charge suddenly appears on your credit card. But your card is in your wallet—it’s not even lost or stolen. Sadly,
you may have been a victim of cyber crime. In this day and age, most transactions take advantage of the benefit of
computers in some way. Cyber crime is any type of crime that uses a computer or computer network. Thankfully, many
people are working to prevent cyber crime. Sometimes known as cryptographers, these people develop complex patterns
in computer codes that block access to would-be thieves as well as write codes to intercept and decode information from
them so that they may be identified. In this chapter, you will explore basic sequences and series related to those used by
computer programmers to prevent cyber crime.

Write the First Few Terms of a Sequence

If we list the function values in order as 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, … we have a sequence. A sequence is a function whose domain
is the counting numbers.

Sequences

A sequence is a function whose domain is the counting numbers.

A sequence can also be seen as an ordered list of numbers and each number in the list is a term. A sequence may have an
infinite number of terms or a finite number of terms. Our sequence has three dots (ellipsis) at the end which indicates the
list never ends. If the domain is the set of all counting numbers, then the sequence is an infinite sequence. Its domain is
all counting numbers and there is an infinite number of counting numbers.

2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …,

If we limit the domain to a finite number of counting numbers, then the sequence is a finite sequence. If we use only the
first four counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4 our sequence would be the finite sequence,

2, 4, 6, 8

Often when working with sequences we do not want to write out all the terms. We want more compact way to show how
each term is defined. When we worked with functions, we wrote f (x) = 2x and we said the expression 2x was the rule
that defined values in the range. While a sequence is a function, we do not use the usual function notation. Instead of
writing the function as f (x) = 2x, we would write it as an = 2n. The an is the nth term of the sequence, the term
in the nth position where n is a value in the domain. The formula for writing the nth term of the sequence is called the
general term or formula of the sequence.

General Term of a Sequence

The general term of the sequence is found from the formula for writing the nth term of the sequence. The nth term
of the sequence, an, is the term in the nth position where n is a value in the domain.

When we are given the general term of the sequence, we can find the terms by replacing n with the counting numbers in
order. For an = 2n,

To find the values of a sequence, we substitute in the counting numbers in order into the general term of the sequence.

EXAMPLE 12.1

Write the first five terms of the sequence whose general term is an = 4n − 3.

Solution

We substitute the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into the formula, an = 4n − 3,

in order.

Solution

We substitute the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into the formula, an = 2n + 1,

of these expressions for a few values, we see that this expression alternates the sign for the terms.

Find a Formula for the General Term (nth Term) of a Sequence

Sometimes we have a few terms of a sequence and it would be helpful to know the general term or nth term. To find the
general term, we look for patterns in the terms. Often the patterns involve multiples or powers. We also look for a pattern
in the signs of the terms.

Use Factorial Notation

Sequences often have terms that are products of consecutive integers. We indicate these products with a special notation
called factorial notation. For example, 5 ! , read 5 factorial, means 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1. The exclamation point is not punctuation
here; it indicates the factorial notation.

Find the Partial Sum

Sometimes in applications, rather than just list the terms, it is important for us to add the terms of a sequence. Rather
than just connect the terms with plus signs, we can use summation notation.

5
For example, a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 can be written as ∑
i = 1
five.” The symbol ∑ means to add and the i is the index of summation. The 1 tells us where to start (initial value) and
the 5 tells us where to end (terminal value).

ai. We read this as “the sum of a sub i from i equals one to

Summation Notation

The sum of the first n terms of a sequence whose nth term is an is written in summation notation as:

n
∑
i = 1

ai = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + … + an

The i is the index of summation and the 1 tells us where to start and the n tells us where to end.

When we add a finite number of terms, we call the sum a partial sum.

Use Summation Notation to Write a Sum

In the last two examples, we went from summation notation to writing out the sum. Now we will start with a sum and
change it to summation notation. This is very similar to finding the general term of a sequence. We will need to look at
the terms and find a pattern. Often the patterns involve multiples or powers.

Determine if a Sequence is Arithmetic

The last section introduced sequences and now we will look at two specific types of sequences that each have special
properties. In this section we will look at arithmetic sequences and in the next section, geometric sequences.

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. The difference
is d, the common difference, for n greater than or
between consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, an − an − 1,
equal to two.

Arithmetic Sequence

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is always the same.
The difference between consecutive terms, an − an − 1,
two.

is d, the common difference, for n greater than or equal to

In each of these sequences, the difference between consecutive terms is constant, and so the sequence is arithmetic.

Find the General Term (nth Term) of an Arithmetic Sequence

Just as we found a formula for the general term of a sequence, we can also find a formula for the general term of an
arithmetic sequence.
Let’s write the first few terms of a sequence where the first term is a1 and the common difference is d. We will then look
for a pattern.
As we look for a pattern we see that each term starts with a1 .

The first term adds 0d to the a1 , the second term adds 1d, the third term adds 2d, the fourth term adds 3d, and the fifth
term adds 4d. The number of ds that were added to a1 is one less than the number of the term. This leads us to the
following

General Term (nth term) of an Arithmetic Sequence

an = a1 + (n − 1)d

The general term of an arithmetic sequence with first term a1 and the common difference d is

We will use this formula in the next example to find the 15th term of a sequence.

an = a1 + (n − 1)d

EXAMPLE 12.15

Find the fifteenth term of a sequence where the first term is 3 and the common difference is 6.

Solution

To find the fifteenth term, a15, use the
formula with a1 = 3 and d = 6.

an = a1 + (n − 1)d

Substitute in the values.

a15 = 3 + (15 − 1)6

EXAMPLE 12.16

Substitute in the values.
Simplify.

Find the twelfth term, a12, using the
formula with a1 = 22, n = 12, and d = −2.

To find the general term, substitute
the values into the formula.

EXAMPLE 12.17

Find the first term and common difference of a sequence where the fifth term is 19 and the eleventh term is 37. Give the
formula for the general term.

Solution

Since we know two terms, we can make a system of equations using the formula for the general term.

Find the Sum of the First n Terms of an Arithmetic Sequence

As with the general sequences, it is often useful to find the sum of an arithmetic sequence. The sum, Sn, of the first n
terms of any arithmetic sequence is written as Sn = a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an. To find the sum by merely adding all the
terms can be tedious. So we can also develop a formula to find the sum of a sequence using the first and last term of the
sequence.
We can develop this new formula by first writing the sum by starting with the first term, a1, and keep adding a d to get
the next term as:

We can also reverse the order of the terms and write the sum by starting with an and keep subtracting d to get the next
term as

Sn = a1 + (a1 + d) + (a1 + 2d) + … + an.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5

Chapter 12 Sequences, Series and Binomial Theorem

1183

If we add these two expressions for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence, we can derive a formula for
the sum of the first n terms of any arithmetic series.

Sn = an + (an – d) + (an – 2d) + … + a1.

_________________________________________________________

Sn = a1
+Sn = an
2Sn = (a1 + an) + (a1 + an) + (a1 + an) + … + (a1 + an)

+ (a1 + d) + (a1 + 2d) + … + an
+ (an − d) + (an − 2d) + … + a1

Because there are n sums of (a1 + an) on the right side of the equation, we rewrite the right side as n(a1 + an).

We divide by two to solve for Sn.

2Sn = n(a1 + an)

Sn = n
2

(a1 + an)

This give us a general formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence.

Sum of the First nTerms of an Arithmetic Sequence

The sum, Sn, of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is

Sn = n
2

(a1 + an)

where a1 is the first term and an is the nth term.

We apply this formula in the next example where the first few terms of the sequence are given.

EXAMPLE 12.18

Find the sum of the first 30 terms of the arithmetic sequence: 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, …

To find the sum, we will use the formula Sn = n

Determine if a Sequence is Geometric

We are now ready to look at the second special type of sequence, the geometric sequence.

A sequence is called a geometric sequence if the ratio between consecutive terms is always the same. The ratio between
consecutive terms in a geometric sequence is r, the common ratio, where n is greater than or equal to two.

Find the General Term (nth Term) of a Geometric Sequence

Just as we found a formula for the general term of a sequence and an arithmetic sequence, we can also find a formula for
the general term of a geometric sequence.
Let’s write the first few terms of the sequence where the first term is a1 and the common ratio is r. We will then look for
a pattern.

As we look for a pattern in the five terms above, we see that each of the terms starts with a1.

The first term, a1,
is not multiplied by any r. In the second term, the a1 is multiplied by r. In the third term, the a1 is
multiplied by r two times ( r · r or r 2 ). In the fourth term, the a1 is multiplied by r three times ( r · r · r or r 3 ) and in the
fifth term, the a1 is multiplied by r four times. In each term, the number of times a1 is multiplied by r is one less than
the number of the term. This leads us to the following

an = a1 r n − 1

General Term (nth term) of a Geometric Sequence

The general term of a geometric sequence with first term a1 and the common ratio r is

an = a1 r n − 1

We will use this formula in the next example to find the fourteenth term of a sequence.

Find the Sum of the First n Terms of a Geometric Sequence

We found the sum of both general sequences and arithmetic sequence. We will now do the same for geometric
sequences. The sum, Sn, of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is written as Sn = a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an. We
can write this sum by starting with the first term, a1, and keep multiplying by r to get the next term as:

Sn = a1 + a1 r + a1 r 2 + ... + a1 r n − 1

Let’s also multiply both sides of the equation by r.

rSn = a1 r + a1 r 2 + a1 r 3 + ... + a1 r n
Next, we subtract these equations. We will see that when we subtract, all but the first term of the top equation and the
last term of the bottom equation subtract to zero.

Sn = a1 + a1 r + a1 r 2 + a1 r 3 + … + a1 r n − 1
rSn =

a1 r + a1 r 2 + a1 r 3 + … + a1 r n − 1 + a1 r n
____________________________________________________
−a1 r n

Sn − rSn = a1

We factor both sides.

To obtain the formula for Sn,
divide both sides by (1 − r).

Sn (1 − r) = a1 (1 − r n)

Sn =

a1 (1 − r n)
1 − r

Sum of the First nTerms of a Geometric Series

The sum, Sn, of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is

Sn =

a1 (1 − r n)
1 − r

where a1 is the first term and r is the common ratio, and r is not equal to one.

We apply this formula in the next example where the first few terms of the sequence are given. Notice the sum of a
geometric sequence typically gets very large when the common ratio is greater than one.

EXAMPLE 12.25

Find the sum of the first 20 terms of the geometric sequence 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, 224, …

Solution

To find the sum, we will use the formula Sn =

a1 (1 − r n)
1 − r

. We know a1 = 7, r = 2, and n = 20.

Knowing a1 = 7, r = 2, and n = 20,
use the sum formula.

Apply Geometric Sequences and Series in the Real World

One application of geometric sequences has to do with consumer spending. If a tax rebate is given to each household,
the effect on the economy is many times the amount of the individual rebate.

EXAMPLE 12.29

The government has decided to give a $1,000 tax rebate to each household in order to stimulate the economy. The
government statistics say that each household will spend 80% of the rebate in goods and services. The businesses and
individuals who benefitted from that 80% will then spend 80% of what they received and so on. The result is called the
multiplier effect. What is the total effect of the rebate on the economy?

Solution

Every time money goes into the economy, 80% of it is spent and is then in the economy to be spent. Again, 80% of this
money is spent in the economy again. This situation continues and so leads us to an infinite geometric series.

1000 + 1000(0.8) + 1000(0.8)2 + …

Here the first term is 1,000, a1 = 1000. The common ratio is 0.8, r = 0.8. We can evaluate this sum since 0.8 < 1.
We use the formula for the sum on an infinite geometric series.

Substitute in the values, a1 = 1,000 and r = 0.8.

Evaluate.

S =

a1
1 − r
S = 1,000

S = 5,000

The total effect of the $1,000 received by each household will be a $5,000 growth in the economy.

An annuity is an investment that is a sequence of equal periodic deposits. We will be looking at annuities that pay the
interest at the time of the deposits. As we develop the formula for the value of an annuity, we are going to let n = 1. That
means there is one deposit per year.

Use Pascal’s Triangle to Expand a Binomial

In our previous work, we have squared binomials either by using FOIL or by using the Binomial Squares Pattern. We can
also say that we expanded (a + b)2.

To expand (a + b)3, we recognize that this is (a + b)2 (a + b) and multiply.

(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2

(a + b)3
(a + b)2 (a + b)

a3 + 3a2 b + 3ab2 + b3
(a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2 b + 3ab2 + b3

To find a method that is less tedious that will work for higher expansions like (a + b)7, we again look for patterns in
some expansions.

Number of terms

(a + b)1 = a + b

(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2

(a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2 b + 3ab2 + b3

Notice the first and last terms show only one variable. Recall that a0 = 1, so we could rewrite the first and last terms to
include both variables. For example, we could expand (a + b)3 to show each term with both variables.

Generally, we don’t show the zero exponents, just as we usually write x rather than 1x.

Patterns in the expansion of (a + b)n

• The number of terms is n + 1.
• The first term is an and the last term is bn.
• The exponents on a decrease by one on each term going left to right.

• The exponents on b increase by one on each term going left to right.

• The sum of the exponents on any term is n.

Let’s look at an example to highlight the last three patterns.

From the patterns we identified, we see the variables in the expansion of (a + b)n, would be

(a + b)n = an + ___an − 1 b1 + ___an − 2 b2 + ... + ___a1 bn − 1 + bn.

To find the coefficients of the terms, we write our expansions again focusing on the coefficients. We rewrite the
coefficients to the right forming an array of coefficients.

The array to the right is called Pascal’s Triangle. Notice each number in the array is the sum of the two closest numbers
in the row above. We can find the next row by starting and ending with one and then adding two adjacent numbers.

This triangle gives the coefficients of the terms when we expand binomials.

In the next example, we will use this triangle and the patterns we recognized to expand the binomial.

EXAMPLE 12.31

Solution

We know the variables for this expansion will follow the pattern we identified. The nonzero exponents of x will start at six
and decrease to one. The nonzero exponents of y will start at one and increase to six. The sum of the exponents in each
term will be six. In our pattern, a = x and b = y.

(a + b)n = an + ___an − 1 b1 + ___an − 2 b2 + ... + ___a1 bn − 1 + bn

We are now ready to use the alternate method of expanding binomials. The Binomial Theorem uses the same pattern
for the variables, but uses the binomial coefficient for the coefficient of each term.

KEY CONCEPTS

12.1 Sequences

• Factorial Notation

If n is a positive integer, then n ! is

We define 0 ! as 1, so 0 ! = 1

• Summation Notation

n ! = n(n − 1)(n − 2) … (3)(2)(1).

The sum of the first n terms of a sequence whose nth term an is written in summation notation as:

n
∑
i = 1

ai = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + … + an

The i is the index of summation and the 1 tells us where to start and the n tells us where to end.
