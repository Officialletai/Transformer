Pre-Algebra - Integers
Objective: Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide Positive and Negative
Numbers.
The ability to work comfortably with negative numbers is ess ential to success in
algebra. For this reason we will do a quick review of adding, s ubtracting, multi-
plying and dividing of integers. Integers are all the positive whole numbers, zero, 
and their opposites (negatives). As this is intended to be a r eview of integers, the
descriptions and examples will not be as detailed as a normal lesson. 
World View Note: The ﬁrst set of rules for working with negative numbers was
written out by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupa. 
When adding integers we have two cases to consider. The ﬁrst i s if the signs
match, both positive or both negative. If the signs match we w ill add the num-
bers together and keep the sign. This is illustrated in the fo llowing examples
Example 1.
− 5+ (− 3) Same sign ,add5+ 3,keep the negative
− 8Our Solution
Example 2.
− 7+ (− 5) Same sign ,add7+ 5,keep the negative
− 12 Our Solution
If the signs don’t match, one positive and one negative numbe r, we will subtract
the numbers (as if they were all positive) and then use the sig n from the larger
number. This means if the larger number is positive, the answ er is positive. If the
larger number is negative, the answer is negative. This is sh own in the following
examples. 
Example 3.
− 7+ 2 Diﬀerent signs ,subtract 7− 2,use sign from bigger number ,negative
− 5Our Solution
Example 4.
− 4+ 6 Diﬀerent signs ,subtract 6− 4,use sign from bigger number ,positive
2Our Solution
7Example 5.
4+(− 3) Diﬀerent signs ,subtract 4− 3,use sign from bigger number ,positive
1 Our Solution
Example 6.
7+(− 10)Diﬀerent signs ,subtract 10 − 7,use sign from bigger number ,negative
− 3Our Solution
For subtraction of negatives we will change the problem to an addition problem
which we can then solve using the above methods. The way we cha nge a subtrac-
tion to an addition is to add the opposite of the number after t he subtraction
sign. Often this method is refered to as “add the opposite.” T his is illustrated in
the following examples. 
Example 7.
8− 3Add the opposite of 3
8+(− 3) Diﬀerent signs ,subtract 8− 3,use sign from bigger number ,positive
5Our Solution
Example 8.
− 4− 6Add the opposite of 6
− 4+ (− 6) Same sign ,add4+ 6,keep the negative
− 10 Our Solution
Example 9.
9− (− 4) Add the opposite of − 4
9 +4 Same sign ,add9+ 4,keep the positive
13 Our Solution
Example 10.
− 6− (− 2) Add the opposite of − 2
− 6 +2 Diﬀerent sign ,subtract 6− 2,use sign from bigger number ,negative
− 4Our Solution
8Multiplication and division of integers both work in a very s imilar pattern. The
short description of the process is we multiply and divide li ke normal, if the signs
match (both positive or both negative) the answer is positiv e. If the signs don’t
match (one positive and one negative) then the answer is nega tive. This is shown
in the following examples
Example 11.
(4)(− 6) Signs do not match ,answer is negative
− 24 Our Solution
Example 12.
− 36
− 9Signs match ,answer is positive
4Our Solution
Example 13.
− 2(− 6) Signs match ,answer is positive
12 Our Solution
Example 14.
15
− 3Signs do not match ,answer is negative
− 5Our Solution
A few things to be careful of when working with integers. Firs t be sure not to
confuse a problem like − 3− 8with − 3(− 8). The second problem is a multipli-
cation problem because there is nothing between the 3 and the parenthesis. If
there is no operation written in between the parts, then we as sume that means we
are multiplying. The − 3− 8problem, is subtraction because the subtraction sep-
arates the 3 from what comes after it. Another item to watch ou t for is to be
careful not to mix up the pattern for adding and subtracting i ntegers with the
pattern for multiplying and dividing integers. They can loo k very similar, for
example if the signs match on addition, the we keep the negati ve, − 3 + (− 7) =− 
10, but if the signs match on multiplication, the answer is po sitive, (− 3)(− 7) =

Pre-Algebra - Fractions
Objective: Reduce, add, subtract, multiply, and divide wit h fractions.
Working with fractions is a very important foundation to alg ebra. Here we will
brieﬂy review reducing, multiplying, dividing, adding, an d subtracting fractions. 
As this is a review, concepts will not be explained in detail a s other lessons are. 
World View Note: The earliest known use of fraction comes from the Middle
Kingdom of Egypt around 2000 BC! 
We always like our ﬁnal answers when working with fractions t o be reduced. 
Reducing fractions is simply done by dividing both the numer ator and denomi-
nator by the same number. This is shown in the following examp le
Example 15.
36
84Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4
36÷4
84÷4=9
21 Both numerator and denominator are still divisible by 3
129÷3
21 ÷3=3
7Our Soultion
The previous example could have been done in one step by divid ing both numer-
ator and denominator by 12. We also could have divided by 2 twi ce and then
divided by 3 once (in any order). It is not important which met hod we use as
long as we continue reducing our fraction until it cannot be r educed any further. 
The easiest operation with fractions is multiplication. We can multiply fractions
by multiplying straight across, multiplying numerators to gether and denominators
together. 
Example 16.

7· 3
5Multiply numerators across and denominators across
18
35Our Solution
When multiplying we can reduce our fractions before we multi ply. We can either
reduce vertically with a single fraction, or diagonally wit h several fractions, as
long as we use one number from the numerator and one number fro m the denomi-
nator. 
Example 17.

3· 4
11 Multiply numerators across and denominators across
20
33Our Solution
Dividing fractions is very similar to multiplying with one e xtra step. Dividing
fractions requires us to ﬁrst take the reciprocal of the seco nd fraction and mul-
tiply. Once we do this, the multiplication problem solves ju st as the previous
problem.

4Multiply numerators across and denominators across

32Our Soultion
To add and subtract fractions we will ﬁrst have to ﬁnd the leas t common denomi-
nator (LCD). There are several ways to ﬁnd an LCD. One way is to ﬁnd the
smallest multiple of the largest denominator that you can al so divide the small
denomiator by. 
Example 19.
Find the LCD of 8and 12 Test multiples of 12
12?12
8Can′tdivide 12 by 8
24?24
8=3 Yes! We can divide 24 by 8! 
24 Our Soultion
Adding and subtracting fractions is identical in process. I f both fractions already
have a common denominator we just add or subtract the numerat ors and keep the
denominator. 
Example 20.

8Same denominator ,add numerators 7 +3

4Our Solution
While5
4can be written as the mixed number 1 1
4, in algebra we will almost never
use mixed numbers. For this reason we will always use the impr oper fraction, not
the mixed number. 
14Example 21.

6Same denominator ,subtract numerators 13 − 9

6Reduce answer ,dividing by 2

3Our Solution
If the denominators do not match we will ﬁrst have to identify the LCD and build
up each fraction by multiplying the numerators and denomina tors by the same
number so the denominator is built up to the LCD. 
Example 22.

Pre-Algebra - Order of Operations
Objective: Evaluate expressions using the order of operati ons, including
the use of absolute value.
When simplifying expressions it is important that we simpli fy them in the correct
order. Consider the following problem done two diﬀerent way s: 
Example 24.
2+5· 3Add First 2+ 5· 3Multiply
7· 3 Multiply 2+15 Add
21 Solution 17 Solution
The previous example illustrates that if the same problem is done two diﬀerent
ways we will arrive at two diﬀerent solutions. However, only one method can be
correct. It turns out the second method, 17, is the correct me thod. The order of
operations ends with the most basic of operations, addition (or subtraction). 
Before addition is completed we must do repeated addition or multiplication (or
division). Before multiplication is completed we must do re peated multiplication
or exponents. When we want to do something out of order and mak e it come ﬁrst
we will put it in parenthesis (or grouping symbols). This lis t then is our order of
operations we will use to simplify expressions. 
Order of Operations :
Parenthesis (Grouping) 
Exponents
Multiply and Divide (Left to Right) 
Add and Subtract (Left to Right) 
Multiply and Divide are on the same level because they are the same operation
(division is just multiplying by the reciprocal). This mean s they must be done left
to right, so some problems we will divide ﬁrst, others we will multiply ﬁrst. The
same is true for adding and subtracting (subtracting is just adding the opposite). 
Often students use the word PEMDAS to remember the order of op erations, as
the ﬁrst letter of each operation creates the word PEMDAS. Ho wever, it is the
author’s suggestion to think about PEMDAS as a vertical word written as: P
E
MD
AS
so we don’t forget that multiplication and division are done left to right (same
with addition and subtraction). Another way students remem ber the order of
operations is to think of a phrase such as “Please Excuse My De ar Aunt Sally”
where each word starts with the same letters as the order of op erations start with. 
World View Note: The ﬁrst use of grouping symbols are found in 1646 in the
Dutch mathematician, Franciscus van Schooten’s text, Viet a. He used a bar over
18the expression that is to be evaluated ﬁrst. So problems like 2(3 + 5) were written
as2· 3+5 . 
Example 25.
2 +3(9 − 4)2Parenthesis ﬁrst
2+3(5)2Exponents
2+ 3( 25)Multiply
2 +75 Add
77 Our Solution
It is very important to remember to multiply and divide from f rom left to right! 
Example 26.
30÷3· 2Divide ﬁrst (left to right !)
10· 2Multiply
20 Our Solution
In the previous example, if we had multiplied ﬁrst, ﬁve would have been the
answer which is incorrect. 
If there are several parenthesis in a problem we will start wi th the inner most
parenthesis and work our way out. Inside each parenthesis we simplify using the
order of operations as well. To make it easier to know which pa renthesis goes with
which parenthesis, diﬀerent types of parenthesis will be us ed such as { } and [ ]
and ( ), these parenthesis all mean the same thing, they are pa renthesis and must
be evaluated ﬁrst. 
Example 27.
2{82− 7[32− 4(32
˜ +1)]( − 1)}Inner most parenthesis ,exponents ﬁrst
2{82− 7[32− 4(9 +1 )](− 1)}Add inside those parenthesis
2{82− 7[32− 4(10)](− 1)}Multiply inside inner most parenthesis
2{82− 7[32− 40](− 1)}Subtract inside those parenthesis
2{82
˜ − 7[− 8](− 1)}Exponents next
2{64− 7[− 8](− 1)}Multiply left to right ,sign with the number
2{64+56(− 1)}Finish multiplying
2{64− 56}Subtract inside parenthesis
2{8}Multiply
16 Our Solution
As the above example illustrates, it can take several steps t o complete a problem. 
The key to successfully solve order of operations problems i s to take the time to
show your work and do one step at a time. This will reduce the ch ance of making
a mistake along the way. 
19There are several types of grouping symbols that can be used b esides parenthesis. 
One type is a fraction bar. If we have a fraction, the entire nu merator and the
entire denominator must be evaluated before we reduce the fr action. In these
cases we can simplify in both the numerator and denominator a t the same time. 
Example 28.
24˜ − (− 8)· 3
15÷5− 1 Exponent in the numerator ,divide in denominator
16− (− 8)· 3

Another type of grouping symbol that also has an operation wi th it, absolute
value. When we have absolute value we will evaluate everythi ng inside the abso-
lute value, just as if it were a normal parenthesis. Then once the inside is com-
pleted we will take the absolute value, or distance from zero , to make the number
positive. 
Example 29.

˜ − (− 8)| + 2| 3+(− 5)2| Evaluate absolute values ﬁrst ,exponents
1+ 3|− 16− (− 8)| +2| 3+25| Add inside absolute values

1+3(8) +2(28)Multiply left to right
1+24+2(28)Finish multiplying
1+24+56 Add left to right
25+56 Add
81 Our Solution
The above example also illustrates an important point about exponents. Expo-
nents only are considered to be on the number they are attache d to. This means
when we see − 42, only the 4 is squared, giving us − (42)or− 16. But when the
negative is in parentheses, such as (− 5)2the negative is part of the number and
is also squared giving us a positive solution, 25.

Pre-Algebra - Properties of Algebra
Objective: Simplify algebraic expressions by substitutin g given values,
distributing, and combining like terms
In algebra we will often need to simplify an expression to mak e it easier to use. 
There are three basic forms of simplifying which we will revi ew here. 
World View Note: The term “Algebra” comes from the Arabic word al-jabr
which means “reunion”. It was ﬁrst used in Iraq in 830 AD by Moh ammad ibn-
Musa al-Khwarizmi. 
The ﬁrst form of simplifying expressions is used when we know what number each
variable in the expression represents. If we know what they r epresent we can
replace each variable with the equivalent number and simpli fy what remains using
order of operations. 
Example 30.
p(q+ 6)whenp=3andq= 5 Replace pwith3andqwith5
(3)((5) + 6) Evaluate parenthesis
(3)(11)Multiply
33 Our Solution
Whenever a variable is replaced with something, we will put t he new number
inside a set of parenthesis. Notice the 3 and 5 in the previous example are in
parenthesis. This is to preserve operations that are someti mes lost in a simple
replacement. Sometimes the parenthesis won’t make a diﬀere nce, but it is a good
habbit to always use them to prevent problems later. 
Example 31.
x+zx(3− z)/parenleftBigx
3/parenrightBig
whenx=− 6andz=− 2Replace all x′swith6andz′swith2
(− 6)+ ( − 2)(− 6)(3− (− 2))/parenleftbigg(− 6)
3/parenrightbigg
Evaluate parenthesis
− 6+(− 2)(− 6)(5)(− 2) Multiply left to right
− 6 +12(5)(− 2) Multiply left to right
− 6+60(− 2) Multiply
− 6− 120 Subtract
− 126 Our Solution
22It will be more common in our study of algebra that we do not kno w the value of
the variables. In this case, we will have to simplify what we c an and leave the
variables in our ﬁnal solution. One way we can simplify expre ssions is to combine
like terms. Like terms are terms where the variables match exactly (exponents
included). Examples of like terms would be 3xyand− 7xyor3a2band8a2bor− 
3and5. If we have like terms we are allowed to add (or subtract) the n umbers in
front of the variables, then keep the variables the same. Thi s is shown in the fol-
lowing examples
Example 32.
5x− 2y− 8x+7yCombine like terms 5x− 8xand− 2y+ 7y
− 3x+5yOur Solution
Example 33.
8x2− 3x+ 7− 2x2+4x− 3Combine like terms 8x2− 2x2and− 3x+4xand7− 3
6x2+x+4 Our Solution
As we combine like terms we need to interpret subtraction sig ns as part of the fol-
lowing term. This means if we see a subtraction sign, we treat the following term
like a negative term, the sign always stays with the term. 
A ﬁnal method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as w e work with prob-
lems there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a pro blem diﬃcult, if not
impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive
property. Using this property we multiply the number in fron t of the parenthesis
by each term inside of the parenthesis. 
Distributive Property :a(b+c)=ab+ac
Several examples of using the distributive property are giv en below. 
Example 34.
4(2x− 7) Multiply each term by 4
8x− 28 Our Solution
Example 35.
− 7(5x− 6) Multiply each term by − 7
− 35+42 Our Solution
In the previous example we again use the fact that the sign goe s with the number, 
this means we treat the − 6as a negative number, this gives (− 7)(− 6) = 42, a
positive number. The most common error in distributing is a s ign error, be very
careful with your signs! 
23It is possible to distribute just a negative through parenth esis. If we have a nega-
tive in front of parenthesis we can think of it like a − 1 in front and distribute the
− 1 through. This is shown in the following example. 
Example 36.
− (4x− 5y+6) Negative can be thought of as − 1 
− 1(4x− 5y+6) Multiply each term by − 1 
− 4x+ 5y− 6Our Solution
Distributing through parenthesis and combining like terms can be combined into
one problem. Order of operations tells us to multiply (distr ibute) ﬁrst then add or
subtract last (combine like terms). Thus we do each problem i n two steps, dis-
tribute then combine. 
Example 37.
5+ 3(2 x− 4) Distribute 3,multipling each term
5+ 6x− 12 Combine like terms 5− 12
− 7+6xOur Solution
Example 38.
3x− 2(4x− 5) Distribute − 2,multilpying each term
3x− 8x+10 Combine like terms 3x− 8x
− 5x+10 Our Solution
In the previous example we distributed − 2, not just 2. This is because we will
always treat subtraction like a negative sign that goes with the number after it. 
This makes a big diﬀerence when we multiply by the − 5inside the parenthesis, 
we now have a positive answer. Following are more involved ex amples of dis-
tributing and combining like terms. 
Example 39.
2(5x− 8)− 6(4x+3) Distribute 2into ﬁrst parenthesis and − 6into second
10x− 16− 24x− 18 Combine like terms 10 x− 24xand− 16− 18
− 14x− 34 Our Solution
Example 40.
4(3x− 8)− (2x− 7) Negative (subtract )in middle can be thought of as − 1 
4(3x− 8)− 1(2x− 7) Distribute 4into ﬁrst parenthesis ,− 1 into second
12x− 32− 2x+ 7 Combine like terms 12 x− 2xand− 32+7
10x− 25 Our Solution

Solving Linear Equations - One Step Equations
Objective: Solve one step linear equations by balancing usi ng inverse
operations
Solving linear equations is an important and fundamental sk ill in algebra. In
algebra, we are often presented with a problem where the answ er is known, but
part of the problem is missing. The missing part of the proble m is what we seek
to ﬁnd. An example of such a problem is shown below. 
Example 41.
4x+16=− 4
Notice the above problem has a missing part, or unknown, that is marked by x. If
we are given that the solution to this equation is − 5, it could be plugged into the
equation, replacing the xwith− 5. This is shown in Example 2. 
Example 42.
4(− 5) +16=− 4Multiply 4(− 5)
− 20+16=− 4Add− 20+16
− 4=− 4True! 
Now the equation comes out to a true statement! Notice also th at if another
number, for example, 3, was plugged in, we would not get a true statement as
seen in Example 3. 
Example 43.
4(3) + 16=− 4Multiply 4(3)
12+16=− 4Add 12 +16
28 /#02− 4False! 
Due to the fact that this is not a true statement, this demonst ates that 3is not
the solution. However, depending on the complexity of the pr oblem, this “guess
and check” method is not very eﬃcient. Thus, we take a more alg ebraic approach
to solving equations. Here we will focus on what are called “o ne-step equations” or
equations that only require one step to solve. While these eq uations often seem
very fundamental, it is important to master the pattern for s olving these problems
so we can solve more complex problems. 
28Addition Problems
To solve equations, the general rule is to do the opposite. Fo r example, consider
the following example. 
Example 44.
x+7 = − 5The7is added to the x
− 7− 7Subtract 7from both sides to get rid of it
x=− 12 Our solution ! 
Then we get our solution, x=− 12. The same process is used in each of the fol-
lowing examples. 
Example 45.
4+x= 8
− 4− 4
x=47 =x+ 9
− 9− 9
− 2=x5 =8+ x
− 8− 8
− 3=x
Table 1. Addition Examples
Subtraction Problems
In a subtraction problem, we get rid of negative numbers by ad ding them to both
sides of the equation. For example, consider the following e xample. 
Example 46.
x− 5=4 The5is negative ,or subtracted from x
+ 5 + 5 Add5to both sides
x=9 Our Solution ! 
Then we get our solution x= 9. The same process is used in each of the following
examples. Notice that each time we are getting rid of a negati ve number by
adding. 
29Example 47.
− 6+x=− 2
+ 6 + 6
x= 4− 10=x− 7
+ 7 + 7
− 3 =x5=− 8+x
+ 8 + 8
13=x
Table 2. Subtraction Examples
Multiplication Problems
With a multiplication problem, we get rid of the number by div iding on both
sides. For example consider the following example. 
Example 48.
4x=20 Variable is multiplied by 4
44 Divide both sides by 4
x= 5 Our solution ! 
Then we get our solution x= 5
With multiplication problems it is very important that care is taken with signs. If
xis multiplied by a negative then we will divide by a negative. This is shown in
example 9. 
Example 49.
− 5x=30 Variable is multiplied by − 5
− 5− 5Divide both sides by − 5
x=− 6Our Solution ! 
The same process is used in each of the following examples. No tice how negative
and positive numbers are handled as each problem is solved. 
Example 50.

x=− 3− 4x=− 20
− 4− 4
x=542=7x

6 =x
Table 3. Multiplication Examples
Division Problems:
In division problems, we get rid of the denominator by multip lying on both sides. 
For example consider our next example. 
Example 51.
x
5=− 3 Variable is divided by 5
(5)x
5=− 3(5) Multiply both sides by 5
x=− 15 Our Solution ! 
Then we get our solution x=− 15. The same process is used in each of the fol-
lowing examples. 
Example 52.

(− 7)x
− 7=− 2(− 7)
x=14x

− 4= 9
(− 4)x
− 4= 9(− 4)
x=− 36
Table 4. Division Examples
The process described above is fundamental to solving equat ions. once this pro-
cess is mastered, the problems we will see have several more s teps. These prob-
lems may seem more complex, but the process and patterns used will remain the
same.

from the Latin, the study of “things” (which we now call varia bles).

Linear Equations - Two-Step Equations
Objective: Solve two-step equations by balancing and using inverse
opperations.
After mastering the technique for solving equations that ar e simple one-step equa-
tions, we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we sol ve two-step equa-
tions, the important thing to remember is that everything wo rks backwards! 
When working with one-step equations, we learned that in ord er to clear a “plus
ﬁve” in the equation, we would subtract ﬁve from both sides. W e learned that to
clear “divided by seven” we multiply by seven on both sides. T he same pattern
applies to the order of operations. When solving for our vari ablex, we use order
of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or sub tract ﬁrst, then
multiply or divide second (then exponents, and ﬁnally any pa rentheses or
grouping symbols, but that’s another lesson). So to solve th e equation in the ﬁrst
example, 
Example 53.
4x− 20=− 8
We have two numbers on the same side as the x. We need to move the 4and the
20 to the other side. We know to move the four we need to divide, and to move
the twenty we will add twenty to both sides. If order of operat ions is done back-
wards, we will add or subtract ﬁrst. Therefore we will add 20 t o both sides ﬁrst. 
Once we are done with that, we will divide both sides by 4. The steps are shown
below. 
4x− 20=− 8Start by focusing on the subtract 20
+20+20 Add 20 to both sides
4x =12 Now we focus on the 4multiplied by x
4 4 Divide both sides by 4
x=3 Our Solution ! 
Notice in our next example when we replace the xwith3we get a true state-
ment. 
4(3)− 20=− 8Multiply 4(3)
12− 20=− 8Subtract 12 − 20
− 8=− 8True! 
33The same process is used to solve any two-step equations. Add or subtract ﬁrst, 
then multiply or divide. Consider our next example and notic e how the same pro-
cess is applied. 
Example 54.
5x+7 = 7 Start by focusing on the plus 7
− 7− 7Subtract 7from both sides
5x= 0 Now focus on the multiplication by 5
5 5 Divide both sides by 5
x= 0 Our Solution ! 
Notice the seven subtracted out completely! Many students g et stuck on this
point, do not forget that we have a number for “nothing left” a nd that number is
zero. With this in mind the process is almost identical to our ﬁrst example. 
A common error students make with two-step equations is with negative signs. 
Remember the sign always stays with the number. Consider the following
example. 
Example 55.
4− 2x=10 Start by focusing on the positive 4
− 4 − 4Subtract 4from both sides
− 2x=6 Negative (subtraction )stays on the 2x
− 2− 2Divide by − 2
x=− 3Our Solution ! 
The same is true even if there is no coeﬃcient in front of the va riable. Consider
the next example. 
Example 56.
8− x= 2 Start by focusing on the positive 8
− 8− 8Subtract 8from both sides
− x=− 6Negative (subtraction )stays on the x
− 1 x=− 6Remember ,no number in front of variable means 1 
34− 1− 1Divide both sides by − 1 
x= 6 Our Solution ! 
Solving two-step equations is a very important skill to mast er, as we study
algebra. The ﬁrst step is to add or subtract, the second is to m ultiply or divide. 
This pattern is seen in each of the following examples. 
Example 57.
− 3x+7= − 8
− 7− 7
− 3x=− 15
− 3− 3

Table 5. Two-Step Equation Examples
As problems in algebra become more complex the process cover ed here will
remain the same. In fact, as we solve problems like those in th e next example, 
each one of them will have several steps to solve, but the last two steps are a two-
step equation like we are solving here. This is why it is very i mportant to master
two-step equations now!

Solving Linear Equations - General Equations
Objective: Solve general linear equations with variables o n both sides.
Often as we are solving linear equations we will need to do som e work to set them
up into a form we are familiar with solving. This section will focus on manipu-
lating an equation we are asked to solve in such a way that we ca n use our pat-
tern for solving two-step equations to ultimately arrive at the solution. 
One such issue that needs to be addressed is parenthesis. Oft en the parenthesis
can get in the way of solving an otherwise easy problem. As you might expect we
can get rid of the unwanted parenthesis by using the distribu tive property. This is
shown in the following example. Notice the ﬁrst step is distr ibuting, then it is
solved like any other two-step equation. 
Example 59.
4(2x− 6)=16 Distribute 4through parenthesis
8x− 24=16 Focus on the subtraction ﬁrst
+24+24 Add 24 to both sides
8x=40 Now focus on the multiply by 8
88 Divide both sides by 8
x=5 Our Solution ! 
Often after we distribute there will be some like terms on one side of the equa-
tion. Example 2 shows distributing to clear the parenthesis and then combining
like terms next. Notice we only combine like terms on the same side of the equa-
tion. Once we have done this, our next example solves just lik e any other two-step
equation. 
Example 60.
3(2x− 4) +9 = 15 Distribute the 3through the parenthesis
6x− 12+9 = 15 Combine like terms ,− 12+9
6x− 3 =15 Focus on the subtraction ﬁrst
+3 +3 Add3to both sides
6x=18 Now focus on multiply by 6
3766 Divide both sides by 6
x=3 Our Solution
A second type of problem that becomes a two-step equation aft er a bit of work is
one where we see the variable on both sides. This is shown in th e following
example. 
Example 61.
4x− 6=2x+10
Notice here the xis on both the left and right sides of the equation. This can
make it diﬃcult to decide which side to work with. We ﬁx this by moving one of
the terms with xto the other side, much like we moved a constant term. It
doesn’t matter which term gets moved, 4xor2x, however, it would be the
author’s suggestion to move the smaller term (to avoid negat ive coeﬃcients). For
this reason we begin this problem by clearing the positive 2xby subtracting 2x
from both sides. 
4x− 6 =2x+10 Notice the variable on both sides
− 2x− 2x Subtract 2xfrom both sides
2x− 6 =10 Focus on the subtraction ﬁrst
+ 6 + 6 Add6to both sides
2x=16 Focus on the multiplication by 2
22 Divide both sides by 2
x=8 Our Solution ! 
The previous example shows the check on this solution. Here t he solution is
plugged into the xon both the left and right sides before simplifying. 
Example 62.
4(8)− 6=2(8) + 10 Multiply 4(8)and2(8)ﬁrst
32− 6 =16+10 Add and Subtract
26=26 True ! 
The next example illustrates the same process with negative coeﬃcients. Notice
ﬁrst the smaller term with the variable is moved to the other s ide, this time by
adding because the coeﬃcient is negative. 
38Example 63.
− 3x+9= 6 x− 27 Notice the variable on both sides ,− 3xis smaller
+ 3x+ 3x Add3xto both sides
9= 9x− 27 Focus on the subtraction by 27
+27 +27 Add 27 to both sides
36= 9x Focus on the mutiplication by 9
99 Divide both sides by 9
4 =x Our Solution
Linear equations can become particularly intersting when t he two processes are
combined. In the following problems we have parenthesis and the variable on both
sides. Notice in each of the following examples we distribut e, then combine like
terms, then move the variable to one side of the equation. 
Example 64.
2(x− 5)+ 3x=x+18 Distribute the 2through parenthesis
2x− 10+ 3x=x+18 Combine like terms 2x+3x
5x− 10=x+18 Notice the variable is on both sides
− x − x Subtract xfrom both sides
4x− 10=18 Focus on the subtraction of 10
+10+10 Add 10 to both sides
4x=28 Focus on multiplication by 4
44 Divide both sides by 4
x= 7 Our Solution
Sometimes we may have to distribute more than once to clear se veral parenthesis. 
Remember to combine like terms after you distribute! 
Example 65.
3(4x− 5)− 4(2x+1) =5 Distribute 3and− 4through parenthesis
12x− 15− 8x− 4 =5 Combine like terms 12 x− 8xand− 15− 4
4x− 19=5 Focus on subtraction of 19
+19+19 Add 19 to both sides
4x=24 Focus on multiplication by 4
3944 Divide both sides by 4
x=6 Our Solution
This leads to a 5-step process to solve any linear equation. W hile all ﬁve steps
aren’t always needed, this can serve as a guide to solving equ ations. 
1. Distribute through any parentheses. 
2. Combine like terms on each side of the equation. 
3. Get the variables on one side by adding or subtracting
4. Solve the remaining 2-step equation (add or subtract then multiply or
divide) 
5. Check your answer by plugging it back in for xto ﬁnd a true statement. 
The order of these steps is very important. 
World View Note: The Chinese developed a method for solving equations that
involved ﬁnding each digit one at a time about 2000 years ago!
We can see each of the above ﬁve steps worked through our next e xample. 
Example 66.
4(2x− 6) +9= 3( x− 7)+ 8xDistribute 4and3through parenthesis
8x− 24+9 =3 x− 21 + 8xCombine like terms − 24+9and3x+ 8x
8x− 15=11 x− 21 Notice the variable is on both sides
− 8x − 8x Subtract 8xfrom both sides
− 15= 3x− 21 Focus on subtraction of 21 
+21 +21 Add 21 to both sides
6 =3x Focus on multiplication by 3
33 Divide both sides by 3
2 =x Our Solution
Check:
4[2(2) − 6] +9 =3[(2) − 7]+ 8(2) Plug2in for each x. Multiply inside parenthesis
4[4− 6] +9= 3[ − 5] +8(2) Finish parentesis on left ,multiply on right
404[− 2]+ 9= − 15+8(2) Finish multiplication on both sides
− 8+9 = − 15+16 Add
1=1 True! 
When we check our solution of x= 2we found a true statement, 1 = 1 . Therefore, 
we know our solution x= 2is the correct solution for the problem. 
There are two special cases that can come up as we are solving t hese linear equa-
tions. The ﬁrst is illustrated in the next two examples. Noti ce we start by dis-
tributing and moving the variables all to the same side. 
Example 67.
3(2x− 5)= 6x− 15 Distribute 3through parenthesis
6x− 15= 6x− 15 Notice the variable on both sides
− 6x − 6x Subtract 6xfrom both sides
− 15=− 15 Variable is gone ! True! 
Here the variable subtracted out completely! We are left wit h a true statement, 
− 15=− 15. If the variables subtract out completely and we are left w ith a true
statement, this indicates that the equation is always true, no matter what xis. 
Thus, for our solution we say all real numbers orR. 
Example 68.
2(3x− 5)− 4x=2x+ 7 Distribute 2through parenthesis
6x− 10− 4x=2x+ 7 Combine like terms 6x− 4x
2x− 10=2x+ 7 Notice the variable is on both sides
− 2x− 2x Subtract 2xfrom both sides
− 10 /#027 Variable is gone ! False! 
Again, the variable subtracted out completely! However, th is time we are left with
a false statement, this indicates that the equation is never true, no matter what x
is. Thus, for our solution we say no solution or∅.

Solving Linear Equations - Fractions
Objective: Solve linear equations with rational coeﬃcient s by multi-
plying by the least common denominator to clear the fraction s.
Often when solving linear equations we will need to work with an equation with
fraction coeﬃcients. We can solve these problems as we have i n the past. This is
demonstrated in our next example.

9Our solution ! 
While this process does help us arrive at the correct solutio n, the fractions can
make the process quite diﬃcult. This is why we have an alterna te method for
dealing with fractions - clearing fractions. Clearing frac tions is nice as it gets rid
of the fractions for the majority of the problem. We can easil y clear the fractions
43by ﬁnding the LCD and multiplying each term by the LCD. This is shown in the
next example, the same problem as our ﬁrst example, but this t ime we will solve
by clearing fractions. 
Example 70.

+42+42 Add 42 to both sides
9x=52 Focus on multiplication by 9
99 Divide both sides by 9
x=52
9Our Solution
The next example illustrates this as well. Notice the 2isn’t a fraction in the ori-
gional equation, but to solve it we put the 2over1 to make it a fraction. 
Example 71.

− 1 − 1Subtract 1 from both sides
− 13=5x Focus on multiplication of 5
55 Divide both sides by 5

5=x Our Solution
We can use this same process if there are parenthesis in the pr oblem. We will ﬁrst
distribute the coeﬃcient in front of the parenthesis, then c lear the fractions. This
is seen in the following example.

3Our Solution
While the problem can take many diﬀerent forms, the pattern t o clear the frac-
tion is the same, after distributing through any parenthese s we multiply each term
by the LCD and reduce. This will give us a problem with no fract ions that is
much easier to solve. The following example again illustrat es this process.

Solving Linear Equations - Formulas
Objective: Solve linear formulas for a given variable.
Solving formulas is much like solving general linear equati ons. The only diﬀerence
is we will have several varaibles in the problem and we will be attempting to solve
for one speciﬁc variable. For example, we may have a formula s uch as A=πr2+
πrs (formula for surface area of a right circular cone) and we m ay be interested in
solving for the varaible s. This means we want to isolate the sso the equation has
son one side, and everything else on the other. So a solution mi ght look like s=
A− πr2
πs. This second equation gives the same information as the ﬁrst , they are
algebraically equivalent, however, one is solved for the ar ea, while the other is
solved for s(slant height of the cone). In this section we will discuss ho w we can
move from the ﬁrst equation to the second. 
When solving formulas for a variable we need to focus on the on e varaible we are
trying to solve for, all the others are treated just like numb ers. This is shown in
the following example. Two parallel problems are shown, the ﬁrst is a normal one-
step equation, the second is a formula that we are solving for x
Example 74.
3x=12 wx=zIn both problems ,xis multiplied by something
33 wwTo isolate the xwe divide by 3orw. 
x= 4 x=z
wOur Solution
We use the same process to solve 3x=12 for xas we use to solve wx=zforx. 
Because we are solving for xwe treat all the other variables the same way we
would treat numbers. Thus, to get rid of the multiplication w e divided by w. This
same idea is seen in the following example. 
Example 75.
m+n=pfornSolving for n,treat all other variables like numbers
− m− m Subtract mfrom both sides
n=p− m Our Solution
Aspandmare not like terms, they cannot be combined. For this reason w e leave
the expression as p− m. This same one-step process can be used with grouping
symbols. 
47Example 76.
a(x− y) =b foraSolving for a,treat(x− y)likeanumber
(x− y)(x− y) Divide both sides by (x− y)
a=b
x− yOur Solution
Because (x− y)is in parenthesis, if we are not searching for what is inside t he
parenthesis, we can keep them together as a group and divide b y that group. 
However, if we are searching for what is inside the parenthes is, we will have to
break up the parenthesis by distributing. The following exa mple is the same for-
mula, but this time we will solve for x. 
Example 77.
a(x− y) =bforxSolving for x,we need to distribute to clear parenthesis
ax− ay=b This is atwo− step equation ,ayis subtracted from our xterm
+ay+ay Addayto both sides
ax=b+ay Thexis multipied by a
a a Divide both sides by a
x=b+ay
aOur Solution
Be very careful as we isolate xthat we do not try and cancel the aon top and
bottom of the fraction. This is not allowed if there is any add ing or subtracting in
the fraction. There is no reducing possible in this problem, so our ﬁnal reduced
answer remains x=b+ay
a. The next example is another two-step problem
Example 78.
y=mx+bformSolving for m,focus on addition ﬁrst
− b − b Subtract bfrom both sides
y− b=mx m is multipied by x. 
x x Divide both sides by x
y− b
x=m Our Solution
It is important to note that we know we are done with the proble m when the
variable we are solving for is isolated or alone on one side of the equation and it
does not appear anywhere on the other side of the equation. 
The next example is also a two-step equation, it is the proble m we started with at
the beginning of the lesson. 
48Example 79.
A=πr2+πrs forsSolving for s,focus on what is added to the term with s
− πr2− πr2Subtract πr2from both sides
A− πr2=πrs s is multipied by πr
πr πr Divide both sides by πr
A− πr2
πr=s Our Solution
Again, we cannot reduce the πrin the numerator and denominator because of the
subtraction in the problem. 
Formulas often have fractions in them and can be solved in muc h the same way
we solved with fractions before. First identify the LCD and t hen multiply each
term by the LCD. After we reduce there will be no more fraction s in the problem
so we can solve like any general equation from there. 
Example 80.
h=2m
nformTo clear the fraction we use LCD =n
(n)h=(n)2m
nMultiply each term by n
nh=2m Reduce nwith denominators
22 Divide both sides by 2
nh
2=m Our Solution
The same pattern can be seen when we have several fractions in our problem. 
Example 81.
a
b+c
b=eforaTo clear the fraction we use LCD =b
(b)a
b+(b)c
b=e(b) Multiply each term by b
a+c=eb Reduce bwith denominators
− c− c Subtract cfrom both sides
a=eb− c Our Solution
Depending on the context of the problem we may ﬁnd a formula th at uses the
same letter, one capital, one lowercase. These represent di ﬀerent values and we
must be careful not to combine a capital variable with a lower case variable. 
Example 82.
a=A
2− bforbUse LCD (2− b)asagroup
49(2− b)a=(2− b)A
2− bMultiply each term by (2− b)
(2− b)a=A reduce (2− b)with denominator
2a− ab=A Distribute through parenthesis
− 2a− 2a Subtract 2afrom both sides
− ab=A− 2a Thebis multipied by − a
− a− a Divide both sides by − a
b=A− 2a
− aOur Solution
Notice the Aandawere not combined as like terms. This is because a formula
will often use a capital letter and lower case letter to repre sent diﬀerent variables. 
Often with formulas there is more than one way to solve for a va riable. The next
example solves the same problem in a slightly diﬀerent manne r. After clearing the
denominator, we divide by ato move it to the other side, rather than distributing. 
Example 83.
a=A
2− bforbUse LCD =(2− b)asagroup
(2− b)a=(2− b)A
2− bMultiply each term by (2− b)
(2− b)a=A Reduce (2− b)with denominator
a a Divide both sides by a
2− b=A
aFocus on the positive 2
− 2− 2 Subtract 2from both sides
− b=A
a− 2 Still need to clear the negative
(− 1)(− b)=(− 1)A
a− 2(− 1) Multiply (or divide )each term by − 1 
b=− A
a+ 2 Our Solution
Both answers to the last two examples are correct, they are ju st written in a dif-
ferent form because we solved them in diﬀerent ways. This is v ery common with
formulas, there may be more than one way to solve for a varaibl e, yet both are
equivalent and correct. 
World View Note: The father of algebra, Persian mathematician Muhammad
ibn Musa Khwarizmi, introduced the fundamental idea of blan cing by subtracting
the same term to the other side of the equation. He called this process al-jabr
which later became the world algebra.

Solving Linear Equations - Absolute Value
Objective: Solve linear absolute value equations.
When solving equations with absolute value we can end up with more than one
possible answer. This is because what is in the absolute valu e can be either nega-
tive or positive and we must account for both possibilities w hen solving equations. 
This is illustrated in the following example. 
Example 84.
| x| =7 Absolute value can be positive or negative
x=7orx=− 7Our Solution
Notice that we have considered two possibilities, both the p ositive and negative. 
Either way, the absolute value of our number will be positive 7. 
World View Note: The ﬁrst set of rules for working with negatives came from
7th century India. However, in 1758, almost a thousand years later, British math-
ematician Francis Maseres claimed that negatives “Darken t he very whole doc-
trines of the equations and make dark of the things which are i n their nature
excessively obvious and simple.”
When we have absolute values in our problem it is important to ﬁrst isolate the
absolute value, then remove the absolute value by consideri ng both the positive
and negative solutions. Notice in the next two examples, all the numbers outside
of the absolute value are moved to the other side ﬁrst before w e remove the abso-
lute value bars and consider both positive and negative solu tions. 
Example 85.
5 +| x| =8 Notice absolute value is not alone
− 5 − 5Subtract 5from both sides
| x| =3 Absolute value can be positive or negative
x=3orx=− 3Our Solution
Example 86.
− 4| x| =− 20 Notice absolute value is not alone
− 4− 4Divide both sides by − 4
52| x| = 5 Absolute value can be positive or negative
x=5orx=− 5Our Solution
Notice we never combine what is inside the absolute value wit h what is outside
the absolute value. This is very important as it will often ch ange the ﬁnal result
to an incorrect solution. The next example requires two step s to isolate the abso-
lute value. The idea is the same as a two-step equation, add or subtract, then
multiply or divide. 
Example 87.
5| x|− 4=26 Notice the absolute value is not alone
+ 4 + 4 Add4to both sides
5| x| =30 Absolute value still not alone
55 Divide both sides by 5
| x| =6 Absolute value can be positive or negative
x=6orx=− 6Our Solution
Again we see the same process, get the absolute value alone ﬁr st, then consider
the positive and negative solutions. Often the absolute val ue will have more than
just a variable in it. In this case we will have to solve the res ulting equations
when we consider the positive and negative possibilities. T his is shown in the next
example. 
Example 88.
| 2x− 1 | = 7 Absolute value can be positive or negative
2x− 1 =7 or2x− 1=− 7Two equations to solve
Now notice we have two equations to solve, each equation will give us a diﬀerent
solution. Both equations solve like any other two-step equa tion. 
2x− 1=7
+ 1 + 1
2x= 8
22
x= 4or2x− 1=− 7
+ 1 + 1
2x=− 6
2 2
x=− 3
53Thus, from our previous example we have two solutions, x= 4orx=− 3. 
Again, it is important to remember that the absolute value mu st be alone ﬁrst
before we consider the positive and negative possibilities . This is illustrated in
below. 
Example 89.
2− 4| 2x+ 3| =− 18
To get the absolute value alone we ﬁrst need to get rid of the 2by subtracting, 
then divide by − 4. Notice we cannot combine the 2and− 4becuase they are
not like terms, the − 4has the absolute value connected to it. Also notice we do
not distribute the − 4into the absolute value. This is because the numbers out-
side cannot be combined with the numbers inside the absolute value. Thus we get
the absolute value alone in the following way: 
2− 4| 2x+ 3| =− 18 Notice absolute value is not alone
− 2 − 2Subtract 2from both sides
− 4| 2x+ 3| =− 20 Absolute value still not alone
− 4 − 4Divide both sides by − 4
| 2x+3| =5 Absoloute value can be positive or negative
2x+3= 5 or2x+ 3= − 5Two equations to solve
Now we just solve these two remaining equations to ﬁnd our sol utions. 
2x+ 3= 5
− 3− 3
2x= 2
22
x= 1 or2x+ 3= − 5
− 3− 3
2x=− 8
22
x=− 4
We now have our two solutions, x= 1 andx=− 4. 
As we are solving absolute value equations it is important to be aware of special
cases. Remember the result of an absolute value must always b e positive. Notice
what happens in the next example. 
54Example 90.
7+| 2x− 5| =4 Notice absolute value is not alone
− 7 − 7Subtract 7from both sides
| 2x− 5| =− 3Result of absolute value is negative ! 
Notice the absolute value equals a negative number! This is i mpossible with abso-
lute value. When this occurs we say there is no solution or∅. 
One other type of absolute value problem is when two absolute values are equal to
eachother. We still will consider both the positive and nega tive result, the diﬀer-
ence here will be that we will have to distribute a negative in to the second abso-
lute value for the negative possibility. 
Example 91.
| 2x− 7| =| 4x+ 6| Absolute value can be positive or negative
2x− 7 =4x+6 or2x− 7=− (4x+ 6) makesecondpartofsecondequationnegative
Notice the ﬁrst equation is the positive possibility and has no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence other than the missing absolute value bars. The second e quation considers
the negative possibility. For this reason we have a negative in front of the expres-
sion which will be distributed through the equation on the ﬁr st step of solving. So
we solve both these equations as follows: 
2x− 7= 4x+ 6
− 2x− 2x
− 7= 2x+6
− 6− 6
− 13= 2x
22
− 13
2=xor2x− 7=− (4x+6)
2x− 7=− 4x− 6
+ 4x+ 4x
6x− 7=− 6
+ 7 + 7
6x= 1 
66
x=1 
6
This gives us our two solutions, x=− 13

Solving Linear Equations - Variation
Objective: Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and
ﬁnding the variation constant.
One application of solving linear equations is variation. O ften diﬀerent events are
related by what is called the constant of variation. For exam ple, the time it takes
to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are tra veling. The faster you
travel, the less time it take to get there. This is one type of v ariation problem, we
will look at three types of variation here. Variation proble ms have two or three
variables and a constant in them. The constant, usually note d with a k, describes
the relationship and does not change as the other variables i n the problem change. 
There are two ways to set up a variation problem, the ﬁrst solv es for one of the
variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. Here we will use the
second method. 
The greek letter pi ( π) is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter. 
World View Note: In the 5th centure, Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi cal-
culated the value of πto seven decimal places (3.1415926). This was the most
accurate value of πfor the next 1000 years! 
If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the cir cle by the diameter
you will always get the same value, about 3.14159... If you ha ve a bigger circum-
ference you will also have a bigger diameter. This relations hip is called direct
variation ordirectly proportional . If we see this phrase in the problem we
know to divide to ﬁnd the constant of variation. 
Example 92.
mis varies directly as n′′Directly′′tells us to divide
m
n=kOur formula for the relationship
In kickboxing, one will ﬁnd that the longer the board, the eas ier it is to break. If
you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board you
will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variab les, which means as
one variable increases, the other variable decreases. This relationship is called
indirect variation orinversly proportional . If we see this phrase in the
problem we know to multiply to ﬁnd the constant of variation.
Example 93.
yis inversely proportional to z′′Inversely′′tells us to multiply
yz=kOur formula for the relationship
57The formula for the area of a triangle has three variables in i t. If we divide the
area by the base times the height we will also get a constant, 1
2. This relationship
is called joint variation orjointly proportional . If we see this phrase in the
problem we know to divide the ﬁrst variable by the product of t he other two to
ﬁnd the constant of variation. 
Example 94.
Avaries jointly as xandy′′Jointly′′tells us to divide by the product
A
xy=kOur formula for the relationship
Once we have our formula for the relationship in a variation p roblem, we use
given or known information to calculate the constant of vari ation. This is shown
for each type of variation in the next three examples. 
Example 95.
wis directly proportional to yandw=50 when y=5
w
y=k′′directly′′tells us to divide
(50)
(5)=kSubstitute known values
10=kEvaluate to ﬁnd our constant
Example 96.
cvaries indirectly as dandc=4.5 when d=6
cd=k′′indirectly′′tells us to multiply
(4.5)(6) = kSubstitute known values
27=kEvaluate to ﬁnd our constant
Example 97.
xis jointly proportional to yandzandx=48 when y= 2andz= 4
x
yz=k′′Jointly′′tells us to divide by the product
(48)
(2)(4)=kSubstitute known values
6 =kEvaluate to ﬁnd our constant
58Once we have found the constant of variation we can use it to ﬁn d other combina-
tions in the same relationship. Each of these problems we sol ve will have three
important steps, none of which should be skipped. 
1. Find the formula for the relationship using the type of var iation
2. Find the constant of variation using known values
3. Answer the question using the constant of variation
The next three examples show how this process is worked out fo r each type of
variation. 
Example 98.
The price of an item varies directly with the sales tax . IfaS25 item has asales tax of S2,
what will the tax be on aS40 item ?
p
t=k′′Directly′′tells us to divide price (p)and tax (t)
(25)
(2)=kSubstitute known values for price and tax
12.5=kEvaluate to ﬁnd our constant
40
t=12.5 Using our constant ,substitute 40 for price to ﬁnd the tax
(t)40
t=12.5(t)Multiply by LCD =tto clear fraction
40=12.5tReduce the twith the denominator
12.5 12.5 Divide by 12.5
3.2=tOur solution : Tax is S3.20
Example 99.
The speed (or rate) Josiah travels to work is inversely propo rtional to time it
takes to get there. If he travels 35 miles per hour it will take him 2.5 hours to get
to work. How long will it take him if he travels 55 miles per hou r?
rt=k′′Inversely′′tells us to multiply the rate and time
(35)(2.5)=kSubstitute known values for rate and time
87.5=kEvaluate to ﬁnd our constant
55t=87.5 Using our constant ,substitute 55 for rate to ﬁnd the time
55 55 Divide both sides by 55
t≈1.59 Our solution : It takes him 1.59 hours to get to work
Example 100.
59The amount of simple interest earned on an investment varies jointly as the prin-
ciple (amount invested) and the time it is invested. In an acc ount, S150 invested
for 2 years earned S12 in interest. How much interest would be earned on a S220
investment for 3 years?

(12)

(660)I
660=0.04(660)Multiply by 660 to isolate the variable
I=26.4 Our Solution : The investment earned S26.40 in interest
Sometimes a variation problem will ask us to do something to a variable as we set
up the formula for the relationship. For example, πcan be thought of as the ratio
of the area and the radius squared. This is still direct varia tion, we say the area
varies directly as the radius square and thus our variable is squared in our for-
mula. This is shown in the next example. 
Example 101.
The area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of the radius. A circle
with a radius of 10 has an area of 314. What will the area be on a c ircle of radius
4?
A
r2=k′′Direct′′tells us to divide ,be sure we use r2for the denominator
(314)
(10)2=kSubstitute known values into our formula
(314)
100=kExponents ﬁrst
3.14=kDivide to ﬁnd our constant
A
(4)2=3.14 Using the constant ,use4forr,don′tforget the squared ! 
A
16=3.14 Evaluate the exponent
(16)A
16=3.14(16)Multiply both sides by 16
A=50.24 Our Solution : Area is 50.24
When solving variation problems it is important to take the t ime to clearly state
the variation formula, ﬁnd the constant, and solve the ﬁnal e quation.

30. At a constant temperature, the volume of a gas varies inve rsely as the pres-
62sure. If the pressure of a certain gas is 40 newtons per square meter when the
volume is 600 cubic meters what will the pressure be when the v olume is
reduced by 240 cubic meters?
31. The time required to empty a tank varies inversely as the r ate of pumping. If
a pump can empty a tank in 45 min at the rate of 600 kL/min, how lo ng will
it take the pump to empty the same tank at the rate of 1000 kL/mi n?
32. The weight of an object varies inversely as the square of t he distance from the
center of the earth. At sea level (6400 km from the center of th e earth), an
astronaut weighs 100 lb. How far above the earth must the astr onaut be in
order to weigh 64 lb?
33. The stopping distance of a car after the brakes have been a pplied varies
directly as the square of the speed r. If a car, traveling 60 mp h can stop in 200
ft, how fast can a car go and still stop in 72 ft?
34. The drag force on a boat varies jointly as the wetted surfa ce area and the
square of the velocity of a boat. If a boat going 6.5 mph experi ences a drag
force of 86 N when the wetted surface area is 41.2 ft2, how fast must a boat
with 28.5 ft2of wetted surface area go in order to experience a drag force o f
94N?
35. The intensity of a light from a light bulb varies inversel y as the square of the

The unit for measuring the intesity of illumination is usual ly the footcandle. If
a given source of light gives an illumination of 1 foot-candl e at a distance of
10 feet, what would the illumination be from the same source a t a distance
of 20 feet?

Linear Equations - Number and Geometry
Objective: Solve number and geometry problems by creating a nd
solving a linear equation.
Word problems can be tricky. Often it takes a bit of practice t o convert the
English sentence into a mathematical sentence. This is what we will focus on here
with some basic number problems, geometry problems, and par ts problems. 
A few important phrases are described below that can give us c lues for how to set
up a problem. 
•A number (or unknown, a value, etc) often becomes our variable
•Is(or other forms of is: was, will be, are, etc) often represent s equals (=) 
xis5becomes x=5
•More than often represents addition and is usually built backwards, 
writing the second part plus the ﬁrst
Three more than a number becomes x+ 3
•Less than often represents subtraction and is usually built backward s as
well, writing the second part minus the ﬁrst
Four less than a number becomes x− 4
Using these key phrases we can take a number problem and set up and equation
and solve. 
Example 102.
If 28 less than ﬁve times a certain number is 232. What is the nu mber?
5x− 28 Subtraction is built backwards ,multiply the unknown by 5
5x− 28=232 Is translates to equals
+28+28 Add 28 to both sides
5x=260 The variable is multiplied by 5
55 Divide both sides by 5
x=52 The number is 52 . 
This same idea can be extended to a more involved problem as sh own in the next
example. 
Example 103.
64Fifteen more than three times a number is the same as ten less t han six times the
number. What is the number
3x+15 First ,addition is built backwards
6x− 10 Then ,subtraction is also built backwards
3x+15= 6x− 10 Is between the parts tells us they must be equal
− 3x− 3x Subtract 3xso variable is all on one side
15= 3x− 10 Now we have atwo− step equation
+10 +10 Add 10 to both sides
25=3xThe variable is multiplied by 3
33 Divide both sides by 3
25
3=xOur number is25
3
Another type of number problem involves consecutive number s. Consecutive
numbers are numbers that come one after the other, such as 3, 4, 5. If we are
looking for several consecutive numbers it is important to ﬁ rst identify what they
look like with variables before we set up the equation. This i s shown in the fol-
lowing example. 
Example 104.
The sum of three consecutive integers is 93. What are the inte gers?
FirstxMake the ﬁrst number x
Second x+1 To get the next number we go up one or +1 
Third x+2 Add another 1(2total)to get the third
F+S+T=93 First (F)plus Second (S)plus Third (T)equals 93
(x)+(x+ 1)+ ( x+2) = 93 Replace Fwithx, Swithx+1 ,andTwithx+2
x+x+1+ x+2 = 93 Here the parenthesis aren′tneeded . 
3x+3 = 93 Combine like terms x+x+xand2+ 1 
− 3− 3Add3to both sides
3x=90 The variable is multiplied by 3
33 Divide both sides by 3
x=30 Our solution for x
First 30 Replace xin our origional list with 30
Second (30) +1 = 31 The numbers are 30 ,31 ,and 32
Third (30) +2 = 32
Sometimes we will work consective even or odd integers, rath er than just consecu-
tive integers. When we had consecutive integers, we only had to add 1 to get to
the next number so we had x, x+ 1 , and x+ 2for our ﬁrst, second, and third
number respectively. With even or odd numbers they are space d apart by two. So
if we want three consecutive even numbers, if the ﬁrst is x, the next number
would be x+ 2, then ﬁnally add two more to get the third, x+ 4. The same is
65true for consecutive odd numbers, if the ﬁrst is x, the next will be x+ 2, and the
third would be x+ 4. It is important to note that we are still adding 2 and 4 even
when the numbers are odd. This is because the phrase “odd” is r efering to our x, 
not to what is added to the numbers. Consider the next two exam ples. 
Example 105.
The sum of three consecutive even integers is 246. What are th e numbers?
FirstxMake the ﬁrst x
Second x+2 Even numbers ,so we add 2to get the next
Third x+4 Add2more(4total)to get the third
F+S+T=246 SummeansaddFirst (F)plusSecond (S)plusThird (T)
(x)+ (x+2) +( x+ 4)= 246 Replace each F ,S, andTwith what we labeled them
x+x+2 + x+ 4= 246 Here the parenthesis are not needed
3x+ 6= 246 Combine like terms x+x+xand2+ 4
− 6− 6Subtract 6from both sides
3x=240 The variable is multiplied by 3
33 Divide both sides by 3
x=80 Our solution for x
First 80 Replace xin the origional list with 80 . 
Second (80)+ 2= 82 The numbers are 80 ,82,and 84 . 
Third (80)+ 4= 84
Example 106.
Find three consecutive odd integers so that the sum of twice t he ﬁrst, the second
and three times the third is 152. 
FirstxMake the ﬁrst x
Second x+2 Odd numbers so we add 2(same as even !)
Third x+4 Add2more(4total)to get the third
2F+S+ 3T=152 Twicetheﬁrstgives 2Fandthreetimesthethirdgives 3T
2(x)+ (x+2) +3( x+4) = 152 Replace F ,S, andTwith what we labled them
2x+x+2 +3 x+12=152 Distribute through parenthesis
6x+14=152 Combine like terms 2x+x+3xand2+14
− 14− 14 Subtract 14 from both sides
6x=138 Variable is multiplied by 6
66 Divide both sides by 6
x=23 Our solution for x
First 23 Replace xwith 23 in the original list
Second (23)+2 = 25 The numbers are 23 ,25,and 27
Third (23)+4 = 27
66When we started with our ﬁrst, second, and third numbers for b oth even and odd
we had x, x+ 2, and x+ 4. The numbers added do not change with odd or even, 
it is our answer for xthat will be odd or even. 
Another example of translating English sentences to mathem atical sentences
comes from geometry. A well known property of triangles is th at all three angles
will always add to 180. For example, the ﬁrst angle may be 50 de grees, the second
30 degrees, and the third 100 degrees. If you add these togeth er, 50 +30+100=
180. We can use this property to ﬁnd angles of triangles. 
World View Note: German mathematician Bernhart Thibaut in 1809 tried to
prove that the angles of a triangle add to 180 without using Eu clid’s parallel pos-
tulate (a point of much debate in math history). He created a p roof, but it was
later shown to have an error in the proof. 
Example 107.
The second angle of a triangle is double the ﬁrst. The third an gle is 40 less than
the ﬁrst. Find the three angles. 
FirstxWith nothing given about the ﬁrst we make that x
Second 2xThe second is double the ﬁrst ,
Third x− 40 The third is 40 less than the ﬁrst
F+S+T=180 All three angles add to 180
(x) +(2x)+ (x− 40)=180 Replace F , S, andTwith the labeled values . 
x+2x+x− 40=180 Here the parenthesis are not needed . 
4x− 40=180 Combine like terms , x+2x+x
+40+40 Add 40 to both sides
4x=220 The variable is multiplied by 4
44 Divide both sides by 4
x=55 Our solution for x
First 55 Replace xwith 55 in the original list of angles
Second 2(55)=110 Our angles are 55 ,110,and 15
Third (55)− 40=15
Another geometry problem involves perimeter or the distanc e around an object. 
For example, consider a rectangle has a length of 8 and a width of 3. There are
two lengths and two widths in a rectangle (opposite sides) so we add 8 + 8 + 3 +
3 =22. As there are two lengths and two widths in a rectangle an al ternative to
ﬁnd the perimeter of a rectangle is to use the formula P= 2L+ 2W. So for the
rectangle of length 8 and width 3 the formula would give, P= 2(8) + 2(3) = 16+
6 =22. With problems that we will consider here the formula P= 2L+ 2Wwill be
used. 
Example 108.
67The perimeter of a rectangle is 44. The length is 5 less than do uble the width. 
Find the dimensions. 
Length xWe will make the length x
Width 2x− 5Width is ﬁve less than two times the length
P=2L+ 2W The formula for perimeter of arectangle
(44) =2(x)+ 2(2 x− 5) Replace P , L, andWwith labeled values
44= 2x+4x− 10 Distribute through parenthesis
44=6x− 10 Combine like terms 2x+4x
+10 +10 Add 10 to both sides
54=6xThe variable is multiplied by 6
66 Divide both sides by 6
9=xOur solution for x
Length 9Replace xwith9in the origional list of sides
Width 2(9)− 5 =13 The dimensions of the rectangle are 9by 13. 
We have seen that it is imortant to start by clearly labeling t he variables in a
short list before we begin to solve the problem. This is impor tant in all word
problems involving variables, not just consective numbers or geometry problems. 
This is shown in the following example. 
Example 109.
A sofa and a love seat together costs S444. The sofa costs double the love seat. 
How much do they each cost?
Love Seat xWith no information about the love seat ,this is our x
Sofa2xSofa is double the love seat ,so we multiply by 2
S+L=444 Together they cost 444 ,so we add . 
(x) +(2x)=444 Replace SandLwith labeled values
3x=444 Parenthesis are not needed ,combine like terms x+2x
33 Divide both sides by 3
x=148 Our solution for x
Love Seat 148 Replace xwith 148 in the origional list
Sofa2(148)=296 The love seat costs S148 and the sofa costs S296. 
Be careful on problems such as these. Many students see the ph rase “double” and
believe that means we only have to divide the 444 by 2 and get S222 for one or
both of the prices. As you can see this will not work. By clearl y labeling the vari-
ables in the original list we know exactly how to set up and sol ve these problems.

Solving Linear Equations - Age Problems
Objective: Solve age problems by creating and solving a line ar equa-
tion.
An application of linear equations is what are called age pro blems. When we are
solving age problems we generally will be comparing the age o f two people both
now and in the future (or past). Using the clues given in the pr oblem we will be
working to ﬁnd their current age. There can be a lot of informa tion in these prob-
lems and we can easily get lost in all the information. To help us organize and
solve our problem we will ﬁll out a three by three table for eac h problem. An
example of the basic structure of the table is below
Age Now Change
Person 1 
Person 2
Table 6. Structure of Age Table
Normally where we see “Person 1” and “Person 2” we will use the name of the
person we are talking about. We will use this table to set up th e following
example. 
Example 110.
Adam is 20 years younger than Brian. In two years Brian will be twice as old as
Adam. How old are they now?
Age Now + 2
Adam
BrianWe use Adam and Brian for our persons
We use +2for change because the second phrase
is two years in the future
Age Now + 2
Adam x− 20
Brain xConsider the′′Now′′part,Adam is 20 years
youger than Brian . We are given information about
Adam ,not Brian . So Brian is xnow. To show Adam
is 20 years younger we subtract 20 ,Adam is x− 20. 
Age Now +2
Adam x− 20x− 20+ 2
Brian x x+2Now the +2column is ﬁlled in . This is done by adding
2to both Adam′sand Brian′snow column as shown
in the table . 
Age Now +2
Adam x− 20x− 18
Brian x x+2Combine like terms in Adam′sfuture age : − 20+ 2
This table is now ﬁlled out and we are ready to try
and solve . 
72B=2AOur equation comes from the future statement : 
Brian will be twice as old as Adam . This means
the younger ,Adam ,needs to be multiplied by 2. 
(x+ 2)= 2( x− 18)Replace BandAwith the information in their future
cells,Adam (A)is replaced with x− 18 and Brian (B)
is replaced with (x+ 2)This is the equation to solve ! 
x+2= 2 x− 36 Distribute through parenthesis
− x− x Subtract xfrom both sides to get variable on one side
2=x− 36 Need to clear the − 36
+36+36 Add 36 to both sides
38=x Our solution for x
Age now
Adam 38− 20=18
Brian 38The ﬁrst column will help us answer the question . 
Replace the x′swith 38 and simplify . 
Adam is 18 and Brian is 38
Solving age problems can be summarized in the following ﬁve s teps. These ﬁve
steps are guidelines to help organize the problem we are tryi ng to solve. 
1. Fill in the now column. The person we know nothing about is x. 
2. Fill in the future/past collumn by adding/subtracting th e change to the
now column. 
3. Make an equation for the relationship in the future. This i s independent of
the table. 
4. Replace variables in equation with information in future cells of table
5. Solve the equation for x, use the solution to answer the question
These ﬁve steps can be seen illustrated in the following exam ple. 
Example 111.
Carmen is 12 years older than David. Five years ago the sum of t heir ages was 28. 
How old are they now?
Age Now − 5
Carmen
DavidFive years ago is − 5in the change column . 
Age Now − 5
Carmen x+12
David xCarmen is 12 years older than David . We don′t
know about David so he is x,Carmen then is x+12
Age Now − 5
Carmen x+12x+12− 5
David x x− 5Subtract 5from now column to get the change
73Age Now − 5
Carmen x+12x+7
David x x− 5Simplify by combining like terms 12 − 5
Our table is ready ! 
C+D=28 The sumoftheirageswillbe 29 . Sowe add CandD
(x+7) +( x− 5) =28 Replace CandDwith the change cells . 
x+ 7+ x− 5=28 Remove parenthesis
2x+ 2= 28 Combine like terms x+xand7− 5
− 2− 2 Subtract 2from both sides
2x=26 Notice xis multiplied by 2
22 Divide both sides by 2
x=13 Our solution for x
Age Now
Caremen 13+12=25
David 13Replace xwith 13 to answer the question
Carmen is 25 and David is 13
Sometimes we are given the sum of their ages right now. These p roblems can be
tricky. In this case we will write the sum above the now column and make the
ﬁrst person’s age now x. The second person will then turn into the subtraction
problem total − x. This is shown in the next example. 
Example 112.
The sum of the ages of Nicole and Kristin is 32. In two years Nic ole will be three
times as old as Kristin. How old are they now?
32
Age Now + 2
Nicole x
Kristen 32− xThe change is +2for two years in the future
The total is placed above Age Now
The ﬁrst person is x. The second becomes 32 − x
Age Now +2
Nicole x x+2
Kristen 32− x32− x+2Add2to each cell ﬁll in the change column
Age Now +2
Nicole x x+ 2
Kristen 32− x34− xCombine like terms 32 + 2,our table is done ! 
N=3K Nicole is three times as old as Kristin . 
(x+2) =3( 34− x) Replace variables with information in change cells
x+ 2= 102− 3x Distribute through parenthesis
+ 3x + 3x Add3xto both sides so variable is only on one side
744x+ 2= 102 Solve the two − step equation
− 2− 2 Subtract 2from both sides
4x=100 The variable is multiplied by 4
44 Divide both sides by 4
x=25 Our solution for x
Age Now
Nicole 25
Kristen 32− 25=7Plug 25 in for xin the now column
Nicole is 25 and Kristin is 7
A slight variation on age problems is to ask not how old the peo ple are, but
rather ask how long until we have some relationship about the ir ages. In this case
we alter our table slightly. In the change column because we d on’t know the time
to add or subtract we will use a variable, t, and add or subtract this from the now
column. This is shown in the next example. 
Example 113.
Louis is 26 years old. Her daughter is 4 years old. In how many y ears will Louis
be double her daughter’s age?
Age Now +t
Louis 26
Daughter 4As we are given their ages now ,these numbers go into
the table . The change is unknown ,so we write +tfor
the change
Age Now +t
Louis 26 26+t
Daughter 4 4+tFill in the change column by adding tto each person′s
age. Our table is now complete . 
L=2D Louis will be double her daughter
(26+t)= 2(4+ t) Replace variables with information in change cells
26+t= 8+2 t Distribute through parenthesis
− t− t Subtract tfrom both sides
26= 8+ t Now we have an 8added to the t
− 8− 8 Subtract 8from both sides
18=t In 18 years she will be double her daughter′sage
Age problems have several steps to them. However, if we take t he time to work
through each of the steps carefully, keeping the informatio n organized, the prob-
lems can be solved quite nicely.

Japan who lived to be 120 years, 237 days. However, his exact a ge has been dis-
puted.

Solving Linear Equations - Distance, Rate and Time
Objective: Solve distance problems by creating and solving a linear
equation.
An application of linear equations can be found in distance p roblems. When
solving distance problems we will use the relationship rt=dor rate (speed) times
time equals distance. For example, if a person were to travel 30 mph for 4 hours. 
To ﬁnd the total distance we would multiply rate times time or (30)(4) = 120. 
This person travel a distance of 120 miles. The problems we wi ll be solving here
will be a few more steps than described above. So to keep the in formation in the
problem organized we will use a table. An example of the basic structure of the
table is blow: 
Rate Time Distance
Person 1 
Person 2
Table 7. Structure of Distance Problem
The third column, distance, will always be ﬁlled in by multip lying the rate and
time columns together. If we are given a total distance of bot h persons or trips we
will put this information below the distance column. We will now use this table to
set up and solve the following example
79Example 114.
Two joggers start from opposite ends of an 8 mile course runni ng towards each
other. One jogger is running at a rate of 4 mph, and the other is running at a
rate of 6 mph. After how long will the joggers meet?
Rate Time Distance

Jogger 26We are given the rates for each jogger . 
These are added to the table
Rate Time Distance
Jogger 1 4 t
Jogger 26 tWe only know they both start and end at the
same time . We use the variable tfor both times
Rate Time Distance
Jogger 1 4 t 4t
Jogger 26 t 6tThe distance column is ﬁlled in by multiplying
rate by time

4t+ 6t= 8 The distance column gives equation by adding
10t= 8 Combine like terms ,4t+ 6t
1010 Divide both sides by 10
t=4
5Our solution for t,4
5hour(48 minutes )
As the example illustrates, once the table is ﬁlled in, the eq uation to solve is very
easy to ﬁnd. This same process can be seen in the following exa mple
Example 115.
Bob and Fred start from the same point and walk in opposite dir ections. Bob
walks 2 miles per hour faster than Fred. After 3 hours they are 30 miles apart. 
How fast did each walk?
Rate Time Distance
Bob 3
Fred 3The basic table with given times ﬁlled in
Both traveled 3hours

Fred r 3Bob walks 2mph faster than Fred
We know nothing about Fred ,so use rfor his rate
Bob is r+ 2,showing 2mph faster
Rate Time Distance
Bob r+ 2 33r+ 6
Fred r 3 3rDistance column is ﬁlled in by multiplying rate by
Time. Be sure to distribute the 3(r+2)for Bob . 
30 Total distance is put under distance
3r+ 6+ 3 r=30 The distance columns is our equation ,by adding
6r+6 = 30 Combine like terms 3r+ 3r
− 6− 6 Subtract 6from both sides
6r=24 The variable is multiplied by 6
66 Divide both sides by 6
r=4 Our solution for r
Rate
Bob 4+2 =6
Fred 4To answer the question completely we plug 4in for
rin the table . Bob traveled 6miles per hour and
Fred traveled 4mph
Some problems will require us to do a bit of work before we can j ust ﬁll in the
cells. One example of this is if we are given a total time, rath er than the indi-
vidual times like we had in the previous example. If we are giv en total time we
will write this above the time column, use tfor the ﬁrst person’s time, and make
a subtraction problem, Total − t, for the second person’s time. This is shown in
the next example
Example 116.
Two campers left their campsite by canoe and paddled downstr eam at an average
speed of 12 mph. They turned around and paddled back upstream at an average
rate of 4 mph. The total trip took 1 hour. After how much time di d the campers
turn around downstream?

16t=4 Variable is multiplied by 16
1616 Divide both sides by 16

4Our solution ,turn around after1 
4hr(15 min )
Another type of a distance problem where we do some work is whe n one person
catches up with another. Here a slower person has a head start and the faster
person is trying to catch up with him or her and we want to know h ow long it
will take the fast person to do this. Our startegy for this pro blem will be to use t
for the faster person’s time, and add amount of time the head s tart was to get the
slower person’s time. This is shown in the next example. 
Example 117.
Mike leaves his house traveling 2 miles per hour. Joy leaves 6 hours later to catch
up with him traveling 8 miles per hour. How long will it take he r to catch up
with him?
Rate Time Distance

As they cover the same distance ,=is put after
Mike′sdistance
2t+12=8t Now the distance column is the equation
− 2t− 2t Subtract 2tfrom both sides
12=6t The variable is multiplied by 6
66 Divide both sides by 6
822 =t Our solution for t,she catches him after 2hours
World View Note: The 10,000 race is the longest standard track event. 10,000
meters is approximately 6.2 miles. The current (at the time o f printing) world
record for this race is held by Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele wit h a time of 26 min-
utes, 17.53 second. That is a rate of 12.7 miles per hour! 
As these example have shown, using the table can help keep all the given informa-
tion organized, help ﬁll in the cells, and help ﬁnd the equati on we will solve. The
ﬁnal example clearly illustrates this. 
Example 118.
On a 130 mile trip a car travled at an average speed of 55 mph and then reduced
its speed to 40 mph for the remainder of the trip. The trip took 2.5 hours. For
how long did the car travel 40 mph?

Graphing - Points and Lines
Objective: Graph points and lines using xycoordinates.
Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation we will mak e a picture that
represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solu-
tions to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a vis ual representa-
tion of an equation, we ﬁrst have to understand the basis of gr aphing. Following
is an example of what is called the coordinate plane. 
-4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3
-2-1 1 2The plane is divided into four sections
by a horizontal number line ( x-axis) 
and a vertical number line ( y-axis). 
Where the two lines meet in the center
is called the origin. This center origin
is where x= 0andy= 0. As we move
to the right the numbers count up
from zero, representing x=1 ,2,3 /#09. 
To the left the numbers count down from zero, representing x=− 1 ,− 2,− 3 /#09. 
Similarly, as we move up the number count up from zero, y= 1 ,2,3 /#09. , and as we
move down count down from zero, y=− 1 ,− 2,− 3. We can put dots on the
graph which we will call points. Each point has an “address” t hat deﬁnes its loca-
tion. The ﬁrst number will be the value on the x− axis or horizontal number line. 
This is the distance the point moves left/right from the orig in. The second
number will represent the value on the y− axis or vertical number line. This is
the distance the point moves up/down from the origin. The poi nts are given as an
ordered pair (x, y). 
World View Note: Locations on the globe are given in the same manner, each
number is a distance from a central point, the origin which is where the prime
meridian and the equator. This “origin is just oﬀ the western coast of Africa. 
The following example ﬁnds the address or coordinate pair fo r each of several
points on the coordinate plane. 
Example 119.
Give the coordinates of each point. 
A
B
C
89Tracing from the origin, point A is
right 1, up 4. This becomes A (1 ,4). 
Point B is left 5, up 3. Left is back-
wards or negative so we have B (− 5,3). C is straight down 2 units. There
is no left or right. This means we go
right zero so the point is C (0,− 2). 
A(1 ,4), B(− 5,3), C(0,− 2) Our Solution
Just as we can give the coordinates for a set of points, we can t ake a set of points
and plot them on the plane. 
Example 120.
Graph the points A(3,2), B(− 2,1), C(3,− 4), D(− 2,− 3), E(− 3,0), F(0,2),
G(0,0)
Right 3Up 2A
Left 2Up 1 BThe ﬁrst point, A is at (3,2)this
means x= 3(right 3) and y=2(up 2). 
Following these instructions, starting
from the origin, we get our point. 
The second point, B(− 2,1), is left 2
(negative moves backwards), up 1. 
This is also illustrated on the graph. 
A
B
D
CRight 3Left 2
Down 3Down 4The third point, C(3,− 4)is right 3, 
down 4 (negative moves backwards). 
The fourth point, D (− 2,− 3)is left
2, down 3 (both negative, both move
backwards) 
The last three points have zeros in them. We still treat these points just like the
other points. If there is a zero there is just no movement. 
Up 2
Left 3

CBF
G ENext is E(− 3,0). This is left 3 (nega-
tive is backwards), and up zero, right
on the x− axis. 
Then is F(0,2). This is right zero, 
and up two, right on the y− axis. 
Finally is G(0,0). This point has no
movement. Thus the point is right on
the origin.

DOur Solution
The main purpose of graphs is not to plot random points, but ra ther to give a
picture of the solutions to an equation. We may have an equati on such as y=
2x− 3. We may be interested in what type of solution are possible in this equa-
tion. We can visualize the solution by making a graph of possi blexandycombi-
nations that make this equation a true statement. We will hav e to start by
ﬁnding possible xandycombinations. We will do this using a table of values. 
Example 121.

What this line tells us is that any point on the line will work i n the equation y=

x= 2, we should get y= 1 . Sure enough, y= 2(2) − 3 = 4− 3 = 1 , just as the graph
suggests. Thus we have the line is a picture of all the solutio ns for y= 2x− 3. We

Graphing - Slope
Objective: Find the slope of a line given a graph or two points .
As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify diﬀerent properties of the
lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope
is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25 , is very steep. A
line with a small slope, such as1
10is very ﬂat. We will also use slope to describe
the direction of the line. A line that goes up from left to righ t will have a positive
slope and a line that goes down from left to right will have a ne gative slope. 
As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to
how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope a s the fractionrise
run. 
Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the y-values. Run would be a hor-
izontal change, or a change in the x-values. So another way to describe slope
would be the fractionchangein y
changein x. It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw
vertical and horiztonal lines from one point to another to ma ke what is called a
slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our sl ope. The following
examples show graphs that we ﬁnd the slope of using this idea.
Example 123.
Run 6Rise− 4To ﬁnd the slope of this line we will
consider the rise, or verticle change
and the run or horizontal change. 
Drawing these lines in makes a slope
triangle that we can use to count from
one point to the next the graph goes
down 4, right 6. This is rise − 4, run
6. As a fraction it would be, − 4
6. 
Reduce the fraction to get − 2
3. 
− 2
3Our Solution
World View Note: When French mathematicians Rene Descartes and Pierre de
Fermat ﬁrst developed the coordinate plane and the idea of gr aphing lines (and
other functions) the y-axis was not a verticle line! 
Example 124.
95Rise 6Run 3To ﬁnd the slope of this line, the rise
is up 6, the run is right 3. Our slope is
then written as a fraction, rise
runor6
3. 
This fraction reduces to 2. This will
be our slope. 
2 Our Solution
There are two special lines that have unique slopes that we ne ed to be aware of. 
They are illustrated in the following example. 
Example 125.
In this graph there is no rise, but the
run is 3 units. This slope becomes
0
3= 0 . This line ,
and all horizontal lines have azero slope . This line has a rise of 5, but no run. 
The slope becomes5
0=
undeﬁned . This line ,
and all vertical lines ,have no slope . 
As you can see there is a big diﬀerence between having a zero sl ope and having no
slope or undeﬁned slope. Remember, slope is a measure of stee pness. The ﬁrst
slope is not steep at all, in fact it is ﬂat. Therefore it has a z ero slope. The
second slope can’t get any steeper. It is so steep that there i s no number large
enough to express how steep it is. This is an undeﬁned slope. 
We can ﬁnd the slope of a line through two points without seein g the points on a
graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the c hange in yvalues, 
we can calculate this by subtracting the yvalues of a point. Similarly, if run is a
change in the xvalues, we can calculate this by subtracting the xvalues of a
point. In this way we get the following equation for slope. 
The slope of aline through (x1, y1)and(x2, y2)isy2− y1
x2− x1
96When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope. 
For this reason we often represent the slope with the variabl em. Now we have
the following for slope. 
Slope =m=rise
run=change in y
change in x=y2− y1
x2− x1
As we subtract the yvalues and the xvalues when calculating slope it is impor-
tant we subtract them in the same order. This process is shown in the following
examples. 
Example 126.
Find the slope between (− 4,3)and(2,− 9) Identify x1, y1,x2, y2
(x1, y1)and(x2, y2)Use slope formula ,m=y2− y1

m=− 1 − 6

2Our Solution
We may come up against a problem that has a zero slope (horizto nal line) or no
slope (vertical line) just as with using the graphs. 
Example 128.
Find the slope between (− 4,− 1)and(− 4,− 5) Identify x1, y1, x2, y2
97(x1, y1)and(x2, y2)Use slope formula ,m=y2− y1

m=− 5− (− 1)

Example 129.

x2− x1
m=1 − 1 
− 2− 3Simplify
m=0
− 5Reduce
m=0 Our Solution
Again, there is a big diﬀerence between no slope and a zero slo pe. Zero is an
integer and it has a value, the slope of a ﬂat horizontal line. No slope has no
value, it is undeﬁned, the slope of a vertical line. 
Using the slope formula we can also ﬁnd missing points if we kn ow what the slope
is. This is shown in the following two examples. 
Example 130.
Find the value of ybetween the points (2, y)and(5,− 1)with slope − 3

Graphing - Slope-Intercept Form
Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and y -inter-
cept.
When graphing a line we found one method we could use is to make a table of
values. However, if we can identify some properties of the li ne, we may be able to
make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is ﬁndin g the slope and
the y-intercept of the equation. The slope can be represente d by mand the y-
intercept, where it crosses the axis and x= 0, can be represented by (0, b)where b
is the value where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis. Any other point on the
line can be represented by (x, y). Using this information we will look at the slope
formula and solve the formula for y. 
Example 132.
m,(0,b),(x, y)Using the slope formula gives : 
y− b
x− 0=m Simplify
y− b
x=m Multiply both sides by x
y− b=mx Addbto both sides
+b+b
y=mx+bOur Solution
This equation, y=mx+bcan be thought of as the equation of any line that as a
slope of mand a y-intercept of b. This formula is known as the slope-intercept
equation. 
Slope − Intercept Equation :y=mx+b
If we know the slope and the y-intercept we can easily ﬁnd the e quation that rep-
resents the line. 
Example 133.
Slope =3
4, y− intercept =− 3Use the slope − intercept equation
y=mx+b m is the slope , bis they− intercept
y=3
4x− 3Our Solution
We can also ﬁnd the equation by looking at a graph and ﬁnding th e slope and y-
intercept. 
Example 134.
102Identify the point where the graph
crosses the y-axis (0,3). This means
the y-intercept is 3. 
Idenﬁty one other point and draw a
slope triangle to ﬁnd the slope. The
slope is − 2
3
y=mx+b Slope-intercept equation
y=− 2
3x+ 3 Our Solution
We can also move the opposite direction, using the equation i dentify the slope
and y-intercept and graph the equation from this informatio n. However, it will be
important for the equation to ﬁrst be in slope intercept form . If it is not, we will
have to solve it for yso we can identify the slope and the y-intercept. 
Example 135.
Write in slope − intercept form : 2x− 4y= 6 Solve for y
− 2x− 2xSubtract 2xfrom both sides
− 4y=− 2x+ 6 Putxterm ﬁrst
− 4− 4− 4Divide each term by − 4
y=1 
2x− 3
2Our Solution
Once we have an equation in slope-intercept form we can graph it by ﬁrst plotting
the y-intercept, then using the slope, ﬁnd a second point and connecting the dots. 
Example 136.
Graph y=1 
2x− 4Recall the slope − intercept formula
y=mx+bIdenﬁty the slope ,m,and the y− intercept , b
m=1 
2, b=− 4Make the graph
Starting with a point at the y-inter-
cept of − 4, 
Then use the sloperise
run, so we will rise
1 unit and run 2 units to ﬁnd the next
point. 
Once we have both points, connect the
dots to get our graph. 
World View Note: Before our current system of graphing, French Mathemati-
cian Nicole Oresme, in 1323 sugggested graphing lines that w ould look more like a
103bar graph with a constant slope! 
Example 137.
Graph 3x+ 4y=12 Not in slope intercept form
− 3x − 3xSubtract 3xfrom both sides
4y=− 3x+12 Put the xterm ﬁrst
4 44 Divide each term by 4
y=− 3
4x+ 3 Recall slope − intercept equation
y=mx+bIdenﬁty mandb
m=− 3
4,b= 3 Make the graph
Starting with a point at the y-inter-
cept of 3, 
Then use the sloperise
run, but its nega-
tive so it will go downhill, so we will
drop 3 units and run 4 units to ﬁnd
the next point. 
Once we have both points, connect the
dots to get our graph. 
We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to ﬁnd the next point with
use a coordinate such as (4,− 2)to ﬁnd an individule point. Coordinates such as
(4,− 2)start from the origin and move horizontally ﬁrst, and vertic ally second. 
Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The
numerator is the vertical change and the denominator is the h orizontal change. 
Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very d iﬀerent. Zero
slope, or horiztonal line, will simply have a slope of zero wh ich when multiplied
byxgives zero. So the equation simply becomes y=boryis equal to the y-coor-
dinate of the graph. If we have no slope, or a vertical line, th e equation can’t be
written in slope intercept at all because the slope is undeﬁn ed. There is no yin
these equations. We will simply make xequal to the x-coordinate of the graph. 
Example 138.
Give the equation of the line in the
graph. 
Because we have a vertical line and no
slope there is no slope-intercept equa-
tion we can use. Rather we make x
equal to the x-coordinate of − 4
x=− 4 Our Solution

Graphing - Point-Slope Form
Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and p oint.
The slope-intercept form has the advantage of being simple t o remember and use, 
however, it has one major disadvantage: we must know the y-in tercept in order to
use it! Generally we do not know the y-intercept, we only know one or more
points (that are not the y-intercept). In these cases we can’ t use the slope inter-
cept equation, so we will use a diﬀerent more ﬂexible formula . If we let the slope
of an equation be m, and a speciﬁc point on the line be (x1, y1), and any other
point on the line be (x, y). We can use the slope formula to make a second equa-
tion. 
Example 139.
m,(x1, y1),(x, y)Recall slope formula
y2− y1
x2− x1=m Plug in values
y− y1
x− x1=m Multiply both sides by (x− x1)
y− y1=m(x− x1)Our Solution
If we know the slope, mof an equation and any point on the line (x1, y1)we can
easily plug these values into the equation above which will b e called the point-
slope formula. 
Point − Slope Formula :y− y1=m(x− x1)

y− y1=m(x− x1)Plug values into point − slope formula
y− (− 4)=3
5(x− 3) Simplify signs
y+ 4=3
5(x− 3) Our Solution
Often, we will prefer ﬁnal answers be written in slope interc ept form. If the direc-
107tions ask for the answer in slope-intercept form we will simp ly distribute the
slope, then solve for y. 
Example 141.

y− y1=m(x− x1)Plug values into point − slope formula

y− 2=− 2
3x− 4Solve for y
+ 2 + 2
y=− 2
3x− 2Our Solution
An important thing to observe about the point slope formula i s that the operation
between the x’s and y’s is subtraction. This means when you simplify the signs
you will have the opposite of the numbers in the point. We need to be very
careful with signs as we use the point-slope formula. 
In order to ﬁnd the equation of a line we will always need to kno w the slope. If
we don’t know the slope to begin with we will have to do some wor k to ﬁnd it
ﬁrst before we can get an equation.

World View Note: The city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) had a
river that ﬂowed through the city breaking it into several pa rts. There were 7
bridges that connected the parts of the city. In 1735 Leonhar d Euler considered
the question of whether it was possible to cross each bridge e xactly once and only
once. It turned out that this problem was impossible, but the work laid the foun-
dation of what would become graph theory.

Graphing - Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Objective: Identify the equation of a line given a parallel o r perpendic-
ular line.
There is an interesting connection between the slope of line s that are parallel and
the slope of lines that are perpendicular (meet at a right ang le). This is shown in
the following example. 
Example 145.
The above graph has two parallel
lines. The slope of the top line is
down 2, run 3, or − 2
3. The slope of
the bottom line is down 2, run 3 as
well, or − 2
3. The above graph has two perpendic-
ular lines. The slope of the ﬂatter line
is up 2, run 3 or
2
3. The slope of the steeper line is down 3,
run2or− 3
2. 
World View Note: Greek Mathematician Euclid lived around 300 BC and pub-
lished a book titled, The Elements . In it is the famous parallel postulate which
mathematicians have tried for years to drop from the list of p ostulates. The
attempts have failed, yet all the work done has developed new types of geome-
tries! 
As the above graphs illustrate, parallel lines have the same slope and perpendic-
ular lines have opposite (one positive, one negative) recip rocal (ﬂipped fraction) 
slopes. We can use these properties to make conclusions abou t parallel and per-
pendicular lines. 
Example 146.
Find the slope of a line parallel to 5y− 2x= 7. 
5y− 2x=7 To ﬁnd the slope we will put equation in slope − intercept form

3Our Solution
Once we have a slope, it is possible to ﬁnd the complete equati on of the second
line if we know one point on the second line. 
Example 148.
Find the equation of a line through (4,− 5)and parallel to 2x− 3y=6.

3x− 19 Our Solution
Zero slopes and no slopes may seem like opposites (one is a hor izontal line, one is
a vertical line). Because a horizontal line is perpendicula r to a vertical line we can
say that no slope and zero slope are actually perpendicular s lopes! 
Example 150.
Find the equation of the line through (3, 4) perpendicular to x=− 2
x=− 2This equation has no slope , avertical line
no slope Perpendicular line then would have azero slope
m= 0 Use this and our point (3,4)

y− 4=0(x− 3) Distribute slope
y− 4= 0 Solve for y
+ 4+ 4 Add4to each side
y= 4 Our Solution
Being aware that to be perpendicular to a vertical line means we have a hori-
zontal line through a yvalue of 4, thus we could have jumped from this point
right to the solution, y=4.

Inequalities - Solve and Graph Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution to
linear inequalities.
When we have an equation such as x= 4we have a speciﬁc value for our variable. 
With inequalities we will give a range of values for our varia ble. To do this we
will not use equals, but one of the following symbols: 
> Greater than
/greaterorequalslant Greater than or equal to
< Less than
/lessorequalslant Less than or equal to
World View Note: English mathematician Thomas Harriot ﬁrst used the above
symbols in 1631. However, they were not immediately accepte d as symbols such
as⊏and⊐were already coined by another English mathematician, Will iam
Oughtred. 
If we have an expression such as x < 4, this means our variable can be any number
smaller than 4 such as − 2,0,3,3.9 or even 3.999999999 as long as it is smaller
118than 4. If we have an expression such as x/greaterorequalslant− 2, this means our variable can be
any number greater than or equal to − 2,such as 5,0,− 1 ,− 1.9999 ,or even − 2. 
Because we don’t have one set value for our variable, it is oft en useful to draw a
picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. W e will start from the
value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is
smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the vari-
able is larger. The value itself we will mark with brackets, e ither ) or ( for less
than or greater than respectively, and ] or [ for less than or e qual to or greater
than or equal to respectively. 
Once the graph is drawn we can quickly convert the graph into w hat is called
interval notation. Interval notation gives two numbers, th e ﬁrst is the smallest
value, the second is the largest value. If there is no largest value, we can use ∞
(inﬁnity). If there is no smallest value, we can use − ∞ negative inﬁnity. If we
use either positive or negative inﬁnity we will always use a c urved bracket for that
value.

Example 152.
Graph the inequality and give the interval notation

Use[for greater than or equal
Our Graph
[− 1 ,∞)Interval Notation
We can also take a graph and ﬁnd the inequality for it. 
119Example 153.
Give the inequality for the graph: 
Graph starts at 3 and goes up or greater. Curved bracket means just greater than
x > 3Our Solution
Example 154.
Give the inequality for the graph: 
Graph starts at − 4and goes down or less. Square bracket means less than or
equal to
x/lessorequalslant− 4Our Solution
Generally when we are graphing and giving interval notation for an inequality we
will have to ﬁrst solve the inequality for our variable. Solv ing inequalities is very
similar to solving equations with one exception. Consider t he following inequality
and what happens when various operations are done to it. Noti ce what happens
to the inequality sign as we add, subtract, multiply and divi de by both positive
and negative numbers to keep the statment a true statement. 
5> 1 Add3to both sides
8> 4Subtract 2from both sides
6> 2Multiply both sides by 3
12> 6Divide both sides by 2
6> 3Add− 1 to both sides
5> 2Subtract − 4from both sides
9> 6Multiply both sides by − 2
− 18< − 12 Divide both sides by − 6
3> 2Symbol ﬂipped when we multiply or divide by anegative ! 
As the above problem illustrates, we can add, subtract, mult iply, or divide on
both sides of the inequality. But if we multiply or divide by a negative number, 
the symbol will need to ﬂip directions. We will keep that in mi nd as we solve
inequalities. 
Example 155.
Solve and give interval notation
5− 2x/greaterorequalslant11 Subtract 5from both sides
120− 5 − 5
− 2x/greaterorequalslant6Divide both sides by − 2
− 2− 2Divide by anegative − ﬂip symbol ! 
x/lessorequalslant− 3Graph ,starting at − 3,going down with ]for less than or equal to
(− ∞,− 3] Interval Notation
The inequality we solve can get as complex as the linear equat ions we solved. We
will use all the same patterns to solve these inequalities as we did for solving
equations. Just remember that any time we multiply or divide by a negative the
symbol switches directions (multiplying or dividing by a po sitive does not change
the symbol!) 
Example 156.
Solve and give interval notation
3(2x− 4)+ 4x< 4(3x− 7)+ 8 Distribute
6x− 12+ 4x< 12x− 28+ 8 Combine like terms
10x− 12< 12x− 20 Move variable to one side
− 10x − 10x Subtract 10 xfrom both sides
− 12< 2x− 20 Add 20 to both sides
+20 +20
8< 2xDivide both sides by 2
22
4< x Be careful with graph , xis larger ! 
(4,∞)Interval Notation
It is important to be careful when the inequality is written b ackwards as in the
previous example ( 4< xrather than x > 4). Often students draw their graphs the
wrong way when this is the case. The inequality symbol opens t o the variable, 
this means the variable is greater than 4. So we must shade abo ve the 4.

Inequalities - Compound Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation to the so lution of
compound inequalities.
Several inequalities can be combined together to form what a re called compound
inequalities. There are three types of compound inequaliti es which we will investi-
gate in this lesson. 
The ﬁrst type of a compound inequality is an OR inequality. Fo r this type of
inequality we want a true statment from either one inequalit y OR the other
inequality OR both. When we are graphing these type of inequa lities we will
graph each individual inequality above the number line, the n move them both
down together onto the actual number line for our graph that c ombines them
together. 
When we give interval notation for our solution, if there are two diﬀerent parts to
the graph we will put a ∪(union) symbol between two sets of interval notation, 
one for each part. 
Example 157.
Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and give interva l notation of solution
2x− 5> 3or4− x/greaterorequalslant6Solve each inequality
+ 5+ 5 − 4− 4Add or subtract ﬁrst
2x> 8or− x/greaterorequalslant2Divide
22− 1 − 1 Dividing by negative ﬂips sign
x > 4orx/lessorequalslant− 2Graph the inequalities separatly above number line
(− ∞,− 2]∪(4,∞)Interval Notation
World View Note: The symbol for inﬁnity was ﬁrst used by the Romans, 
although at the time the number was used for 1000. The greeks a lso used the
symbol for 10,000. 
There are several diﬀerent results that could result from an OR statement. The
graphs could be pointing diﬀerent directions, as in the grap h above, or pointing in
the same direction as in the graph below on the left, or pointi ng opposite direc-
tions, but overlapping as in the graph below on the right. Not ice how interval
notation works for each of these cases. 
124As the graphs overlap, we take the
largest graph for our solution. 
Interval Notation: (− ∞,1)When the graphs are combined they
cover the entire number line. 
Interval Notation: (− ∞,∞)orR
The second type of compound inequality is an AND inequality. AND inequalities
require both statements to be true. If one is false, they both are false. When we
graph these inequalities we can follow a similar process, ﬁr st graph both inequali-
ties above the number line, but this time only where they over lap will be drawn
onto the number line for our ﬁnal graph. When our solution is g iven in interval
notation it will be expressed in a manner very similar to sing le inequalities (there
is a symbol that can be used for AND, the intersection - ∩, but we will not use it
here). 
Example 158.
Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and express it in terval notation. 
2x+8/greaterorequalslant5x− 7and5x− 3> 3x+1 Move variables to one side
− 2x− 2x − 3x− 3x

33 22
5/greaterorequalslantxandx > 2Graph , xis smaller (or equal )than 5,
greater than 2
(2,5] Interval Notation
Again, as we graph AND inequalities, only the overlapping pa rts of the individual
graphs makes it to the ﬁnal number line. As we graph AND inequa lities there are
also three diﬀerent types of results we could get. The ﬁrst is shown in the above
125example. The second is if the arrows both point the same way, t his is shown
below on the left. The third is if the arrows point opposite wa ys but don’t
overlap, this is shown below on the right. Notice how interva l notation is
expressed in each case. 
In this graph, the overlap is only the
smaller graph, so this is what makes it
to the ﬁnal number line. 
Interval Notation: (− ∞,− 2)In this graph there is no overlap of the
parts. Because their is no overlap, no
values make it to the ﬁnal number
line. 
Interval Notation: No Solution or ∅
The third type of compound inequality is a special type of AND inequality. When
our variable (or expression containing the variable) is bet ween two numbers, we
can write it as a single math sentence with three parts, such a s5< x/lessorequalslant8, to show
xis between 5 and 8 (or equal to 8). When solving these type of in equalities, 
because there are three parts to work with, to stay balanced w e will do the same
thing to all three parts (rather than just both sides) to isol ate the variable in the
middle. The graph then is simply the values between the numbe rs with appro-
priate brackets on the ends.

Inequalities - Absolute Value Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation for the s olution to
inequalities with absolute values.
When an inequality has an absolute value we will have to remov e the absolute
value in order to graph the solution or give interval notatio n. The way we remove
the absolute value depends on the direction of the inequalit y symbol. 
Consider | x| < 2. 
Absolute value is deﬁned as distance from zero. Another way t o read this
inequality would be the distance from zero is less than 2. So o n a number line we
will shade all points that are less than 2 units away from zero . 
This graph looks just like the graphs of the three part compou nd inequalities! 
When the absolute value is less than a number we will remove the absolute value
by changing the problem to a three part inequality, with the n egative value on the
left and the positive value on the right. So | x| < 2becomes − 2< x < 2, as the
graph above illustrates. 
Consider | x| > 2. 
Absolute value is deﬁned as distance from zero. Another way t o read this
inequality would be the distance from zero is greater than 2. So on the number
line we shade all points that are more than 2 units away from ze ro. 
This graph looks just like the graphs of the OR compound inequ alities! When the
absolute value is greater than a number we will remove the absolute value by
changing the problem to an OR inequality, the ﬁrst inequalit y looking just like
the problem with no absolute value, the second ﬂipping the in equality symbol and
changing the value to a negative. So | x| > 2becomes x > 2orx < − 2, as the graph
above illustrates. 
World View Note: The phrase “absolute value” comes from German mathemati-
cian Karl Weierstrass in 1876, though he used the absolute va lue symbol for com-
plex numbers. The ﬁrst known use of the symbol for integers co mes from a 1939
128edition of a college algebra text! 
For all absolute value inequalities we can also express our a nswers in interval
notation which is done the same way it is done for standard com pound inequali-
ties. 
We can solve absolute value inequalities much like we solved absolute value equa-
tions. Our ﬁrst step will be to isolate the absolute value. Ne xt we will remove the
absolute value by making a three part inequality if the absol ute value is less than
a number, or making an OR inequality if the absolute value is g reater than a
number. Then we will solve these inequalites. Remember, if w e multiply or divide
by a negative the inequality symbol will switch directions!

In the previous example, we cannot combine − 4and− 3because they are not like
terms, the − 3has an absolute value attached. So we must ﬁrst clear the − 4by
adding 4, then divide by − 3. The next example is similar.

Interval Notation
In the previous example, we cannot distribute the − 2into the absolute value. 
We can never distribute or combine things outside the absolu te value with what is
inside the absolute value. Our only way to solve is to ﬁrst iso late the absolute
value by clearing the values around it, then either make a com pound inequality
(and OR or a three part) to solve. 
130It is important to remember as we are solving these equations , the absolute value
is always positive. If we end up with an absolute value is less than a negative
number, then we will have no solution because absolute value will always be posi-
tive, greater than a negative. Similarly, if absolute value is greater than a nega-
tive, this will always happen. Here the answer will be all rea l numbers.

Systems of Equations - Graphing
Objective: Solve systems of equations by graphing and ident ifying the
point of intersection.
We have solved problems like 3x− 4 = 11 by adding 4 to both sides and then
dividing by 3 (solution is x= 5). We also have methods to solve equations with
more than one variable in them. It turns out that to solve for m ore than one vari-
able we will need the same number of equations as variables. F or example, to
solve for two variables such as xandywe will need two equations. When we have
several equations we are using to solve, we call the equation s asystem of equa-
tions . When solving a system of equations we are looking for a solut ion that
works in both equations. This solution is usually given as an ordered pair (x, y). 
The following example illustrates a solution working in bot h equations
Example 165.
Show (2,1) is the solution to the system3x− y=5
x+y= 3
(2,1) Identify xandyfrom the orderd pair
x=2, y= 1 Plug these values into each equation
3(2)− (1)= 5 First equation
6− 1= 5 Evaluate
5= 5 True
(2)+ (1)= 3 Second equation ,evaluate
3= 3 True
As we found a true statement for both equations we know (2,1) i s the solution to
the system. It is in fact the only combination of numbers that works in both
equations. In this lesson we will be working to ﬁnd this point given the equations. 
It seems to follow that if we use points to describe the soluti on, we can use graphs
to ﬁnd the solutions. 
If the graph of a line is a picture of all the solutions, we can g raph two lines on
the same coordinate plane to see the solutions of both equati ons. We are inter-
134ested in the point that is a solution for both lines, this woul d be where the lines
intersect! If we can ﬁnd the intersection of the lines we have found the solution
that works in both equations. 
Example 166.
y=− 1 
2x+ 3
y=3
4x− 2To graph we identify slopes and y− intercepts
First: m=− 1 
2, b=3
Second : m=3
4,b=− 2Now we can graph both lines on the same plane . 
(4,1) To graph each equation, we start at
the y-intercept and use the sloperise
run
to get the next point and connect the
dots. 
Remember a negative slope is down-
hill! 
Find the intersection point, (4,1) 
(4,1) Our Solution
Often our equations won’t be in slope-intercept form and we w ill have to solve
both equations for yﬁrst so we can idenﬁty the slope and y-intercept. 
Example 167.
6x− 3y=− 9
2x+2y=− 6Solve each equation for y
6x− 3y=− 9 2 x+ 2y=− 6
− 6x − 6x− 2x − 2xSubtract xterms
− 3y=− 6x− 9 2 y=− 2x− 6Putxterms ﬁrst
− 3− 3− 3 2 22 Divide by coeﬃcient of y
y= 2x+3 y=− x− 3Identify slope and y− intercepts
135First: m=2
1 ,b=3
Second : m=− 1 
1 ,b=− 3Now we can graph both lines on the same plane
(-2,-1) To graph each equation, we start at
the y-intercept and use the sloperise
run
to get the next point and connect the
dots. 
Remember a negative slope is down-
hill! 
Find the intersection point, (− 2,− 1)
(− 2,− 1) Our Solution
As we are graphing our lines, it is possible to have one of two u nexpected results. 
These are shown and discussed in the next two example. 
Example 168.
y=3
2x− 4
y=3
2x+1 Identify slope and y− intercept of each equation
First: m=3
2, b=− 4
Second : m=3
2, b=1 Now we can graph both equations on the same plane
To graph each equation, we start at
the y-intercept and use the sloperise
run
to get the next point and connect the
dots. 
The two lines do not intersect! They
are parallel! If the lines do not inter-
sect we know that there is no point
that works in both equations, there is
no solution
∅No Solution
We also could have noticed that both lines had the same slope. Remembering
136that parallel lines have the same slope we would have known th ere was no solu-
tion even without having to graph the lines. 
Example 169.
2x− 6y=12
3x− 9y=18Solve each equation for y
2x− 6y=12 3x− 9y=18
− 2x − 2x− 3x − 3xSubtract xterms
− 6y=− 2x+12 − 9y=− 3x+18 Put xterms ﬁrst
− 6− 6− 6 − 9− 9− 9Divide by coeﬃcient of y
y=1 
3x− 2 y=1 
3x− 2Identify the slopes and y− intercepts
First: m=1 
3, b=− 2
Second : m=1 
3,b=− 2Now we can graph both equations together
To graph each equation, we start at
the y-intercept and use the sloperise
run
to get the next point and connect the
dots. 
Both equations are the same line! As
one line is directly on top of the other
line, we can say that the lines “inter-
sect” at all the points! Here we say we
have inﬁnite solutions
Once we had both equations in slope-intercept form we could h ave noticed that
the equations were the same. At this point we could have state d that there are
inﬁnite solutions without having to go through the work of gr aphing the equa-
tions. 
World View Note: The Babylonians were the ﬁrst to work with systems of
equations with two variables. However, their work with syst ems was quickly
passed by the Greeks who would solve systems of equations wit h three or four
variables and around 300 AD, developed methods for solving s ystems with any
number of unknowns!

Systems of Equations - Substitution
Objective: Solve systems of equations using substitution.
When solving a system by graphing has several limitations. F irst, it requires the
graph to be perfectly drawn, if the lines are not straight we m ay arrive at the
wrong answer. Second, graphing is not a great method to use if the answer is
really large, over 100 for example, or if the answer is a decim al the that graph will
not help us ﬁnd, 3.2134 for example. For these reasons we will rarely use graphing
to solve our systems. Instead, an algebraic approach will be used. 
The ﬁrst algebraic approach is called substitution. We will build the concepts of
substitution through several example, then end with a ﬁve-s tep process to solve
problems using this method. 
Example 170.
x=5
y=2x− 3We already know x= 5,substitute this into the other equation
y= 2(5)− 3Evaluate ,multiply ﬁrst
y=10− 3Subtract
y= 7 We now also have y
(5,7) Our Solution
When we know what one variable equals we can plug that value (o r expression) in
for the variable in the other equation. It is very important t hat when we substi-
tute, the substituted value goes in parenthesis. The reason for this is shown in the
next example. 
Example 171.
2x− 3y= 7
y= 3x− 7We know y= 3x− 7,substitute this into the other equation
2x− 3(3x− 7)=7 Solve this equation ,distributing − 3ﬁrst
1392x− 9x+21 =7 Combine like terms 2x− 9x
− 7x+21 =7 Subtract 21 
− 21− 21
− 7x=− 14 Divide by − 7
− 7− 7
x=2 We now have our x,plug into the y=equation to ﬁnd y
y=3(2)− 7Evaluate ,multiply ﬁrst
y=6− 7Subtract
y=− 1 We now also have y
(2,− 1) Our Solution
By using the entire expression 3x− 7to replace yin the other equation we were
able to reduce the system to a single linear equation which we can easily solve for
our ﬁrst variable. However, the lone variable (a variable wi thout a coeﬃcient) is
not always alone on one side of the equation. If this happens w e can isolate it by
solving for the lone variable. 
Example 172.
3x+2y=1 
x− 5y=6Lone variable is x,isolate by adding 5yto both sides . 
+ 5y+ 5y
x= 6+5 ySubstitute this into the untouched equation
3(6 + 5 y)+2y=1 Solve this equation ,distributing 3ﬁrst
18+15y+2y=1 Combine like terms 15 y+ 2y
18+17y=1 Subtract 18 from both sides
− 18 − 18
17y=− 17 Divide both sides by 17
17 17
y=− 1 We have our y,plug this into the x=equation to ﬁnd x
x= 6+5 (− 1) Evaluate ,multiply ﬁrst
x= 6− 5Subtract
x=1 We now also have x
(1 ,− 1) Our Solution
The process in the previous example is how we will solve probl ems using substitu-
140tion. This process is described and illustrated in the follo wing table which lists
the ﬁve steps to solving by substitution.

Solution (− 1 ,− 3)
Sometimes we have several lone variables in a problem. In thi s case we will have
the choice on which lone variable we wish to solve for, either will give the same
ﬁnal result. 
Example 173.
x+y=5
x− y=− 1 Find the lone variable : xoryin ﬁrst ,orxin second . 
We will chose xin the ﬁrst
x+y=5 Solve for the lone variable ,subtract yfrom both sides
− y− y
x=5− yPlug into the untouched equation ,the second equation
(5− y)− y=− 1 Solve,parenthesis are not needed here ,combine like terms
5− 2y=− 1 Subtract 5from both sides
− 5 − 5
− 2y=− 6Divide both sides by − 2
− 2− 2
y=3 We have our y! 
x= 5− (3) Plug into lone variable equation ,evaluate
x=2 Now we have our x
141 (2,3) Our Solution
Just as with graphing it is possible to have no solution ∅(parallel lines) or
inﬁnite solutions (same line) with the substitution method . While we won’t have
a parallel line or the same line to look at and conclude if it is one or the other, 
the process takes an interesting turn as shown in the followi ng example. 
Example 174.
y+4= 3 x
2y− 6x=− 8Find the lone variable , yin the ﬁrst equation
y+ 4= 3 xSolve for the lone variable ,subtract 4from both sides

2(3x− 4)− 6x=− 8Solve,distribute through parenthesis
6x− 8− 6x=− 8Combine like terms 6x− 6x
− 8 =− 8Variables are gone ! Atrue statement . 
Inﬁnite solutions Our Solution
Because we had a true statement, and no variables, we know tha t anything that
works in the ﬁrst equation, will also work in the second equat ion. However, we do
not always end up with a true statement. 
Example 175.
6x− 3y=− 9
− 2x+y=5Find the lone variable , yin the second equation
− 2x+y= 5 Solve for the lone variable ,add2xto both sides

No Solution ∅ Our Solution
Because we had a false statement, and no variables, we know th at nothing will
work in both equations. 
142World View Note: French mathematician Rene Descartes wrote a book which
included an appendix on geometry. It was in this book that he s uggested using
letters from the end of the alphabet for unknown values. This is why often we are
solving for the variables x, y, andz. 
One more question needs to be considered, what if there is no l one variable? If
there is no lone variable substitution can still work to solv e, we will just have to
select one variable to solve for and use fractions as we solve . 
Example 176.

Using the fractions does make the problem a bit more tricky. T his is why we have
another method for solving systems of equations that will be discussed in another
lesson.

Systems of Equations - Addition/Elimination
Objective: Solve systems of equations using the addition/e limination
method.
When solving systems we have found that graphing is very limi ted when solving
equations. We then considered a second method known as subst ituion. This is
probably the most used idea in solving systems in various are as of algebra. How-
ever, substitution can get ugly if we don’t have a lone variab le. This leads us to
our second method for solving systems of equations. This met hod is known as
either Elimination or Addition. We will set up the process in the following exam-
ples, then deﬁne the ﬁve step process we can use to solve by eli mination. 
Example 177.
3x− 4y= 8
5x+4y=− 24Notice opposites in front of y′s. Add columns . 
8x =− 16 Solve for x,divide by 8
8 8
x=− 2We have our x! 
5(− 2)+ 4 y=− 24 Plug into either original equation ,simplify
− 10+ 4y=− 24 Add 10 to both sides
+10 +10
4y=− 14 Divide by 4

y=− 7
2Now we have our y!

Our Solution
In the previous example one variable had opposites in front o f it, − 4yand4y. 
Adding these together eliminated the y completely. This all owed us to solve for
thex. This is the idea behind the addition method. However, gener ally we won’t
have opposites in front of one of the variables. In this case w e will manipulate the
equations to get the opposites we want by multiplying one or b oth equations (on
both sides!). This is shown in the next example. 
Example 178.
− 6x+5y=22
2x+3y=2We can get opposites in front of x,by multiplying the
second equation by 3,to get − 6xand+ 6x
3(2x+ 3y)= (2)3 Distribute to get new second equation . 
1466x+9y= 6 New second equation
− 6x+5y=22 First equation still the same ,add
14y=28 Divide both sides by 14
14 14
y= 2 We have our y! 
2x+3(2)= 2 Plug into one of the original equations ,simplify
2x+6= 2 Subtract 6from both sides
− 6− 6
2x=− 4Divide both sides by 2
22
x=− 2We also have our x! 
(− 2,2) Our Solution
When we looked at the xterms, − 6xand2xwe decided to multiply the 2xby 3
to get the opposites we were looking for. What we are looking f or with our oppo-
sites is the least common multiple (LCM) of the coeﬃcients. W e also could have
solved the above problem by looking at the terms with y, 5yand3y. The LCM of
3 and 5 is 15. So we would want to multiply both equations, the 5yby 3, and the
3yby− 5to get opposites, 15 yand− 15y. This illustrates an important point, 
some problems we will have to multiply both equations by a con stant (on both
sides) to get the opposites we want. 
Example 179.
3x+6y=− 9
2x+9y=− 26We can get opposites in front of x,ﬁnd LCM of 6and9,
The LCM is 18 . We will multiply to get 18 yand− 18y
3(3x+6y) =(− 9)3 Multiply the ﬁrst equation by 3,both sides ! 
9x+18y=− 27
− 2(2x+ 9y)= (− 26)(− 2) Multiply the second equation by − 2,both sides ! 
− 4x− 18y=52
9x+18y=− 27 Add two new equations together
− 4x− 18y=52
5x =25 Divide both sides by 5
5 5
x= 5 We have our solution for x
3(5)+ 6 y=− 9Plug into either original equation ,simplify
15+ 6y=− 9Subtract 15 from both sides
− 15 − 15
1476y=− 24 Divide both sides by 6
6 6
y=− 4Now we have our solution for y
(5,− 4) Our Solution
It is important for each problem as we get started that all var iables and constants
are lined up before we start multiplying and adding equation s. This is illustrated
in the next example which includes the ﬁve steps we will go thr ough to solve a
problem using elimination.

World View Note : The famous mathematical text, The Nine Chapters on the
Mathematical Art , which was printed around 179 AD in China describes a for-
mula very similar to Gaussian elimination which is very simi lar to the addition
method. 
148Just as with graphing and substution, it is possible to have n o solution or inﬁnite
solutions with elimination. Just as with substitution, if t he variables all disappear
from our problem, a true statment will indicate inﬁnite solu tions and a false stat-
ment will indicate no solution.

We have covered three diﬀerent methods that can be used to sol ve a system of
two equations with two variables. While all three can be used to solve any
system, graphing works great for small integer solutions. S ubstitution works great
when we have a lone variable, and addition works great when th e other two
methods fail. As each method has its own strengths, it is impo rtant you are
familiar with all three methods.

Systems of Equations - Three Variables
Objective: Solve systems of equations with three variables using addi-
tion/elimination.
Solving systems of equations with 3 variables is very simila r to how we solve sys-
tems with two variables. When we had two variables we reduced the system down
to one with only one variable (by substitution or addition). With three variables
we will reduce the system down to one with two variables (usua lly by addition), 
which we can then solve by either addition or substitution. 
To reduce from three variables down to two it is very importan t to keep the work
organized. We will use addition with two equations to elimin ate one variable. 
This new equation we will call (A). Then we will use a diﬀerent pair of equations
and use addition to eliminate the same variable. This second new equation we
will call (B). Once we have done this we will have two equation s (A) and (B) 
with the same two variables that we can solve using either met hod. This is shown
in the following examples. 
Example 182.
3x+2y− z=− 1 
− 2x− 2y+3z= 5 We will eliminate yusing two diﬀerent pairs of equations
5x+2y− z= 3
151 3x+2y− z=− 1 Using the ﬁrst two equations ,
− 2x− 2y+3z= 5 Add the ﬁrst two equations

− 2x− 2y+3z= 5 Using the second two equations
5x+2y− z= 3 Add the second two equations
(B) 3x +2z= 8 This is equation (B),our second equation
(A)x+2z= 4 Using (A)and(B)we will solve this system . 
(B) 3x+2z= 8 We will solve by addition

2y+ 5= − 1 Solve,subtract 5
− 5− 5
2y=− 6Divide by 2
22
y=− 3We now have y! 
(2,− 3,1) Our Solution
As we are solving for x, y, andzwe will have an ordered triplet (x, y, z )instead of
152just the ordered pair (x, y). In this above problem, ywas easily eliminated using
the addition method. However, sometimes we may have to do a bi t of work to get
a variable to eliminate. Just as with addition of two equatio ns, we may have to
multiply equations by something on both sides to get the oppo sites we want so a
variable eliminates. As we do this remmeber it is improtant t o eliminate the
same variable both times using two diﬀerent pairs of equations. 
Example 183.
4x− 3y+2z=− 29 No variable will easily eliminate . 
6x+ 2y− z=− 16 We could choose any variable ,so we chose x

Equations with three (or more) variables are not any more diﬃ cult than two vari-
ables if we are careful to keep our information organized and eliminate the same
variable twice using two diﬀerent pairs of equations. It is p ossible to solve each
system several diﬀerent ways. We can use diﬀerent pairs of eq uations or eliminate
variables in diﬀerent orders, but as long as our information is organized and our
algebra is correct, we will arrive at the same ﬁnal solution.

Systems of Equations - Value Problems
Objective: Solve value problems by setting up a system of equ ations.
One application of system of equations are known as value pro blems. Value prob-
lems are ones where each variable has a value attached to it. F or example, if our
variable is the number of nickles in a person’s pocket, those nickles would have a
value of ﬁve cents each. We will use a table to help us set up and solve value
problems. The basic structure of the table is shown below. 
Number Value Total
Item1 
Item2
Total
The ﬁrst column in the table is used for the number of things we have. Quite
often, this will be our variables. The second column is used f or the that value
each item has. The third column is used for the total value whi ch we calculate by
multiplying the number by the value. For example, if we have 7 dimes, each with
a value of 10 cents, the total value is 7· 10=70 cents. The last row of the table is
for totals. We only will use the third row (also marked total) for the totals that
158are given to use. This means sometimes this row may have some b lanks in it. 
Once the table is ﬁlled in we can easily make equations by addi ng each column, 
setting it equal to the total at the bottom of the column. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example. 
Example 186.
In a child’s bank are 11 coins that have a value of S1.85. The coins are either
quarters or dimes. How many coins each does child have?

Quarter q 25 25q
Dime d 10 10d
Total 11 185We have 11 coins total . This is the number total . 
We have 1.85 for the ﬁnal total ,
Write ﬁnal total in cents (185)
Because 25 and 10 are cents
q+d=11 Firstandlastcolumnsareourequationsbyadding
25q+10d=185 Solve by either addition or substitution . 
− 10(q+d) =(11 )(− 10) Using addition ,multiply ﬁrst equation by − 10
− 10q− 10d=− 110
− 10q− 10d=− 110 Add together equations
25q+10d=185
15q =75 Divide both sides by 15
15 15
q= 5 We have our q,number of quarters is 5
(5) +d=11 Plug into one of original equations
− 5 − 5 Subtract 5from both sides
d= 6 We have our d,number of dimes is 6
1595quarters and 6dimes Our Solution
World View Note: American coins are the only coins that do not state the
value of the coin. On the back of the dime it says “one dime” (no t 10 cents). On
the back of the quarter it says “one quarter” (not 25 cents). O n the penny it
says “one cent” (not 1 cent). The rest of the world (Euros, Yen , Pesos, etc) all
write the value as a number so people who don’t speak the langu age can easily
use the coins. 
Ticket sales also have a value. Often diﬀerent types of ticke ts sell for diﬀerent
prices (values). These problems can be solve in much the same way. 
Example 187.
There were 41 tickets sold for an event. Tickets for children costS1.50 and tickets
for adults cost S2.00. Total receipts for the event were S73.50. How many of each
type of ticket were sold?

a=41 − (17) Plug into a=equation to ﬁnd a
a=24 We have our a,number of adult tickets is 24
17 child tickets and 24 adult tickets Our Solution
Some problems will not give us the total number of items we hav e. Instead they
will give a relationship between the items. Here we will have statements such
as “There are twice as many dimes as nickles”. While it is clea r that we need to
multiply one variable by 2, it may not be clear which variable gets multiplied by
2. Generally the equations are backwards from the English se ntence. If there are
twice as many dimes, than we multiply the other variable (nic kels) by two. So the
equation would be d=2n. This type of problem is in the next example. 
Example 188.
A man has a collection of stamps made up of 5 cent stamps and 8 ce nt stamps. 
There are three times as many 8 cent stamps as 5 cent stamps. Th e total value of
all the stamps is S3.48. How many of each stamp does he have?

The same process for solving value problems can be applied to solving interest
problems. Our table titles will be adjusted slightly as we do so. 
Invest Rate Interest

Account 2
Total
Our ﬁrst column is for the amount invested in each account. Th e second column
is the interest rate earned (written as a decimal - move decim al point twice left), 
and the last column is for the amount of interset earned. Just as before, we mul-
tiply the investment amount by the rate to ﬁnd the ﬁnal column , the interest
earned. This is shown in the following example. 
Example 189.
A woman invests S4000 in two accounts, one at 6% interest, the other at 9%
interest for one year. At the end of the year she had earned S270 in interest. How
much did she have invested in each account?

Systems of Equations - Mixture Problems
Objective: Solve mixture problems by setting up a system of e quations.
One application of systems of equations are mixture problem s. Mixture problems
are ones where two diﬀerent solutions are mixed together res ulting in a new ﬁnal
solution. We will use the following table to help us solve mix ture problems: 
Amount Part Total
Item1 
Item2
Final
The ﬁrst column is for the amount of each item we have. The seco nd column is
labeled “part”. If we mix percentages we will put the rate (wr itten as a decimal) 
in this column. If we mix prices we will put prices in this colu mn. Then we can
multiply the amount by the part to ﬁnd the total. Then we can ge t an equation
by adding the amount and/or total columns that will help us so lve the problem
and answer the questions. 
These problems can have either one or two variables. We will s tart with one vari-
able problems. 
Example 191.
A chemist has 70 mL of a 50% methane solution. How much of a 80% s olution
must she add so the ﬁnal solution is 60% methane?
Amount Part Total
Start 70 0.5
Add x 0.8
FinalSet up the mixture table . We start with 70 ,but
don′tknow how much we add ,that is x. The part
is the percentages ,0.5 for start ,0.8 for add . 
167Amount Part Total
Start 70 0.5
Add x 0.8
Final 70+x0.6Add amount column to get ﬁnal amount . The
part for this amount is 0.6 because we want the
ﬁnal solution to be 60 %methane . 
Amount Part Total
Start 70 0.5 35
Add x 0.8 0.8x
Final 70+x0.6 42+0.6xMultiply amount by part to get total . 
be sure to distribute on the last row :(70+x)0.6
35+0.8x=42+0.6x The last column is our equation by adding
− 0.6x − 0.6x Move variables to one side ,subtract 0.6 x
35+0.2x=42 Subtract 35 from both sides
− 35 − 35
0.2x=7 Divide both sides by 0.2
0.20.2
x=35 We have our x! 
35 mL must be added Our Solution
The same process can be used if the starting and ﬁnal amount ha ve a price
attached to them, rather than a percentage. 
Example 192.
A coﬀee mix is to be made that sells for S2.50 by mixing two types of coﬀee. The
cafe has 40 mL of coﬀee that costs S3.00. How much of another coﬀee that costs

we do not know but we do know its cost is S1.50.

Final 40+x2.5Add the amounts to get the ﬁnal amount . 
We want this ﬁnal amount to sell for S2.50.

20mL must be added . Our Solution
World View Note: Brazil is the world’s largest coﬀee producer, producing 2.5 9
million metric tons of coﬀee a year! That is over three times a s much coﬀee as

The above problems illustrate how we can put the mixture tabl e together and get
an equation to solve. However, here we are interested in syst ems of equations, 
with two unknown values. The following example is one such pr oblem. 
Example 193.
A farmer has two types of milk, one that is 24% butterfat and an other which is
18% butterfat. How much of each should he use to end up with 42 g allons of 20%

Final 42 0.2 8.4Multiply amount by part to get totals . 
x+y=42 The amount column gives one equation
0.24x+0.18y=8.4 The total column gives asecond equation . 
169− 0.18(x+y) =(42)(− 0.18) Use addition . Multiply ﬁrst equation by − 0.18
− 0.18x− 0.18y=− 7.56
− 0.18x− 0.18y=− 7.56 Add the equations together
0.24x+0.18y=8.4
0.06x =0.84 Divide both sides by 0.06
0.06 0.06
x=14 We have our x,14 gal of 24 %butterfat
(14)+y=42 Plug into original equation to ﬁnd y
− 14 − 14 Subtract 14 from both sides
y=28 We have our y,28 gal of 18 %butterfat
14 gal of 24 %and 28 gal of 18 % Our Solution
The same process can be used to solve mixtures of prices with t wo unknowns.

With mixture problems we often are mixing with a pure solutio n or using water
which contains none of our chemical we are interested in. For pure solutions, the
percentage is 100% (or 1 in the table). For water, the percent age is 0%. This is
shown in the following example.

tion. How much of each should be used to make 70 L?

Polynomials - Exponent Properties
Objective: Simplify expressions using the properties of ex ponents.
Problems with expoenents can often be simpliﬁed using a few b asic exponent
properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication . We will use this fact to
discover the important properties. 
World View Note: The word exponent comes from the Latin “expo” meaning
out of and “ponere” meaning place. While there is some debate , it seems that the
Babylonians living in Iraq were the ﬁrst to do work with expon ents (dating back
to the 23rd century BC or earlier!) 
Example 196.
a3a2Expand exponents to multiplication problem
(aaa)(aa)Now we have 5a′sbeing multiplied together
a5Our Solution
A quicker method to arrive at our answer would have been to jus t add the expo-
nents: a3a2=a3+2=a5This is known as the product rule of exponents
Product Rule of Exponents :aman=am+n
The product rule of exponents can be used to simplify many pro blems. We will
add the exponent on like variables. This is shown in the follo wing examples
Example 197.
32· 36· 3Same base ,add the exponents 2+ 6+1 
39Our Solution
Example 198.
2x3y5z· 5xy2z3Multiply 2· 5,add exponents on x, yandz
10x4y7z4Our Solution
Rather than multiplying, we will now try to divide with expon ents
Example 199.
a5
a2Expand exponents
aaaaa
aaDivide out two of the a′s
aaa Convert to exponents
a3Our Solution
177A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to j ust subtract the
exponents, a5
a2=a5− 2=a3. This is known as the quotient rule of exponents. 
Quotient Rule of Exponents :am
an=am− n
The quotient rule of exponents can similarly be used to simpl ify exponent prob-
lems by subtracting exponents on like variables. This is sho wn in the following
examples. 
Example 200.
713
75Same base ,subtract the exponents
78Our Solution
Example 201.
5a3b5c2
2ab3cSubtract exponents on a, bandc
5
2a2b2cOur Solution
A third property we will look at will have an exponent problem raised to a second
exponent. This is investigated in the following example. 
Example 202.
/parenleftbiga2/parenrightbig3This means we have a2three times
a2· a2· a2Add exponents
a6Our solution
A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to j ust multiply the
exponents, (a2)3=a2· 3=a6. This is known as the power of a power rule of expo-
nents. 
Power of aPower Rule of Exponents : (am)n=amn
This property is often combined with two other properties wh ich we will investi-
gate now. 
Example 203.
(ab)3This means we have (ab)three times
(ab)(ab)(ab)Three a′sand three b′scan be written with exponents
a3b3Our Solution
178A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to t ake the exponent
of three and put it on each factor in parenthesis, (ab)3=a3b3. This is known as
the power of a product rule or exponents. 
Power of aProduct Rule of Exponents : (ab)m=ambm
It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multipli-
cation inside parenthesis. This property does NOT work if th ere is addition or
subtraction. 
Warning 204.
(a+b)m/#02am+bmThese are NOT equal,beware of this error ! 
Another property that is very similar to the power of a produc t rule is considered
next. 
Example 205.
/parenleftBiga
b/parenrightBig3
This means we have the fraction three timse
/parenleftBiga
b/parenrightBig/parenleftBiga
b/parenrightBig/parenleftBiga
b/parenrightBig
Multiply fractions across the top and bottom ,using exponents
a3
b3Our Solution
A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to p ut the exponent
on every factor in both the numerator and denominator, /parenleftbiga
b/parenrightbig3=a3
b3. This is known
as the power of a quotient rule of exponents. 
Power of aQuotient Rule of Exponents :/parenleftBiga
b/parenrightBigm
=am
bm
The power of a power, product and quotient rules are often use d together to sim-
plify expressions. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 206.
(x3yz2)4Put the exponent of 4on each factor ,multiplying powers
x12y4z8Our solution
179Example 207.
/parenleftbigga3b
c8d5/parenrightbigg2
Put the exponent of 2on each factor ,multiplying powers
a6b2
c8d10Our Solution
As we multiply exponents its important to remember these pro perties apply to
exponents, not bases. An expressions such as 53does not mean we multipy 5 by 3, 
rather we multiply 5 three times, 5× 5× 5 = 125. This is shown in the next
example. 
Example 208.
(4x2y5)3Put the exponent of 3on each factor ,multiplying powers
43x6y15Evaluate 43
64x6y15Our Solution
In the previous example we did not put the 3 on the 4 and multipy to get 12, this
would have been incorrect. Never multipy a base by the expone nt. These proper-
ties pertain to exponents only, not bases. 
In this lesson we have discussed 5 diﬀerent exponent propert ies. These rules are
summarized in the following table. 
Rules of Exponents
Product Rule of Exponents aman=am+n
Quotient Rule of Exponentsam
an=am− n
Power of aPower Rule of Exponents (am)n=amn
Power of aProduct Rule of Exponents (ab)m=ambm
Power of aQuotient Rule of Exponents/parenleftBiga
b/parenrightBigm
=am
bm
These ﬁve properties are often mixed up in the same problem. O ften there is a bit
of ﬂexibility as to which property is used ﬁrst. However, ord er of operations still
applies to a problem. For this reason it is the suggestion of t he auther to simplify
inside any parenthesis ﬁrst, then simplify any exponents (u sing power rules), and
ﬁnally simplify any multiplication or division (using prod uct and quotient rules). 
This is illustrated in the next few examples. 
Example 209.
(4x3y· 5x4y2)3In parenthesis simplify using product rule ,adding exponents
(20x7y3)3With power rules ,put three on each factor ,multiplying exponents
203x21 y9Evaluate 203
8000x21 y9Our Solution
180Example 210.
7a3(2a4)3Parenthesis are already simpliﬁed ,next use power rules
7a3(8a12)Using product rule ,add exponents and multiply numbers
56a15Our Solution
Example 211.
3a3b· 10a4b3
2a4b2Simplify numerator with product rule ,adding exponents
30a7b4
2a4b2Now use the quotient rule to subtract exponents
15a3b2Our Solution
Example 212.
3m8n12
(m2n3)3Use power rule in denominator
3m8n12
m6n9Use quotient rule
3m2n3Our solution
Example 213.
/parenleftbigg3ab2(2a4b2)3
6a5b7/parenrightbigg2
Simplify inside parenthesis ﬁrst ,using power rule in numerator
/parenleftbigg3ab2(8a12b6)
6a5b7/parenrightbigg2
Simplify numerator using product rule
/parenleftbigg24a13b8
6a5b7/parenrightbigg2
Simplify using the quotient rule
/parenleftbig4a8b)2Now that the parenthesis are simpliﬁed ,use the power rules
16a16b2Our Solution
Clearly these problems can quickly become quite involved. R emember to follow
order of operations as a guide, simplify inside parenthesis ﬁrst, then power rules, 
then product and quotient rules.

Polynomials - Negative Exponents
Objective: Simplify expressions with negative exponents u sing the
properties of exponents.
There are a few special exponent properties that deal with ex ponents that are not
positive. The ﬁrst is considered in the following example, w hich is worded out 2
diﬀerent ways: 
Example 214.
a3
a3Use the quotient rule to subtract exponents
a0Our Solution ,but now we consider the problem athe second way : 
a3
a3Rewrite exponents as repeated multiplication
aaa
aaaReduce out all the a′s
1 
1 = 1 Our Solution ,when we combine the two solutions we get : 
a0= 1 Our ﬁnal result . 
This ﬁnal result is an imporant property known as the zero pow er rule of expo-
nents
Zero Power Rule of Exponents :a0= 1
Any number or expression raised to the zero power will always be 1. This is illus-
trated in the following example. 
Example 215.
(3x2)0Zero power rule
1 Our Solution
Another property we will consider here deals with negative e xponents. Again we
will solve the following example two ways. 
183Example 216.

a2Our Solution ,putting these solutions together gives : 
a− 2=1 
a2Our Final Solution
This example illustrates an important property of exponent s. Negative exponents
yield the reciprocal of the base. Once we take the reciprical the exponent is now
positive. Also, it is important to note a negative exponent d oes not mean the
expression is negative, only that we need the reciprocal of t he base. Following are
the rules of negative exponents
Rules of Negative Exponets :a− m=1
m
1
a− m=am
/parenleftBiga
b/parenrightBig− m
=bm
am
Negative exponents can be combined in several diﬀerent ways . As a general rule if
we think of our expression as a fraction, negative exponents in the numerator
must be moved to the denominator, likewise, negative expone nts in the denomi-
nator need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exp onent moves, 
the exponent is now positive. This is illustrated in the foll owing example. 
Example 217.
a3b− 2c
2d− 1e− 4f2Negative exponents on b, d,andeneed to ﬂip
a3cde4
2b2f2Our Solution
184As we simpliﬁed our fraction we took special care to move the b ases that had a
negative exponent, but the expression itself did not become negative because of
those exponents. Also, it is important to remember that expo nents only eﬀect
what they are attached to. The 2 in the denominator of the abov e example does
not have an exponent on it, so it does not move with the d. 
We now have the following nine properties of exponents. It is important that we
are very familiar with all of them.

World View Note: Nicolas Chuquet, the French mathematician of the 15th cen-
tury wrote 121m¯to indicate 12 x− 1. This was the ﬁrst known use of the negative
exponent. 
Simplifying with negative exponents is much the same as simp lifying with positive
exponents. It is the advice of the author to keep the negative exponents until the
end of the problem and then move them around to their correct l ocation (numer-
ator or denominator). As we do this it is important to be very c areful of rules for
adding, subtracting, and multiplying with negatives. This is illustrated in the fol-
lowing examples
Example 218.
4x− 5y− 3· 3x3y− 2
6x− 5y3Simplify numerator with product rule ,adding exponents
12x− 2y− 5
6x− 5y3Quotient rule to subtract exponets ,be careful with negatives ! 
(− 2)− (− 5) =( − 2)+5 =3
(− 5)− 3= (− 5)+ ( − 3) =− 8
2x3y− 8Negative exponent needs to move down to denominator

185Example 219.

18b9Our Solution
In the previous example it is important to point out that when we simpliﬁed 3− 2
we moved the three to the denominator and the exponent became positive. We
did not make the number negative! Negative exponents never m ake the bases neg-
ative, they simply mean we have to take the reciprocal of the b ase. One ﬁnal
example with negative exponents is given here. 
Example 220.

Polynomials - Scientiﬁc Notation
Objective: Multiply and divide expressions using scientiﬁ c notation and
exponent properties.
One application of exponent properties comes from scientiﬁ c notation. Scientiﬁc
notation is used to represent really large or really small nu mbers. An example of
really large numbers would be the distance that light travel s in a year in miles. 
An example of really small numbers would be the mass of a singl e hydrogen atom
in grams. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these
numbers would normally be very combersome. However, our exp onent properties
make this process much simpler. 
First we will take a look at what scientiﬁc notation is. Scien tiﬁc notation has two
parts, a number between one and ten (it can be equal to one, but not ten), and
that number multiplied by ten to some exponent. 
Scientiﬁc Notation :a× 10bwhere 1/lessorequalslanta < 10
The exponent, b, is very important to how we convert between scientiﬁc notat ion
and normal numbers, or standard notation. The exponent tell s us how many
times we will multiply by 10. Multiplying by 10 in aﬀect moves the decimal point
one place. So the exponent will tell us how many times the expo nent moves
between scientiﬁc notation and standard notation. To decid e which direction to
move the decimal (left or right) we simply need to remember th at positive expo-
nents mean in standard notation we have a big number (bigger t han ten) and neg-
ative exponents mean in standard notation we have a small num ber (less than
one). 
Keeping this in mind, we can easily make conversions between standard notation
and scientiﬁc notation. 
Example 221.
Convert 14 ,200 to scientiﬁc notation Put decimal after ﬁrst nonzero num ber
1.42 Exponent is how many times decimal moved ,4
× 104Positive exponent ,standard notation is big
1.42× 104Our Solution
Example 222.
Convert 0.0042 to scientiﬁc notation Put decimal after ﬁrst nonzero number
4.2 Exponent is how many times decimal moved ,3
× 10− 3Negative exponent ,standard notation is small
4.2× 10− 3Our Solution
188Example 223.

321 ,000 Our Solution
Example 224.
Conver 7.4 × 10− 3to standard notation Negativeexponentmeansstandardnota tion
isasmallnumber . Move decimalleft 3places
0.0074 Our Solution
Converting between standard notation and scientiﬁc notati on is important to
understand how scientiﬁc notation works and what it does. He re our main
interest is to be able to multiply and divide numbers in scien tiﬁc notation using
exponent properties. The way we do this is ﬁrst do the operati on with the front
number (multiply or divide) then use exponent properties to simplify the 10’s. 
Scientiﬁc notation is the only time where it will be allowed t o have negative expo-
nents in our ﬁnal solution. The negative exponent simply inf orms us that we are
dealing with small numbers. Consider the following example s. 
Example 225.
(2.1 × 10− 7)(3.7× 105)Deal with numbers and 10′sseparately
(2.1 )(3.7)=7.77 Multiply numbers
10− 7105=10− 2Use product rule on 10′sand add exponents

3.1 =1.6 Divide Numbers

10− 3=107Use quotient rule to subtract exponents ,be careful with negatives ! 
Be careful with negatives ,4− (− 3) =4 +3= 7

189Example 227.

1.83=5.832 Evaluate 1.83
(10− 4)3=10− 12Multiply exponents
5.832× 10− 12Our Solution
Often when we multiply or divide in scientiﬁc notation the en d result is not in sci-
entiﬁc notation. We will then have to convert the front numbe r into scientiﬁc
notation and then combine the 10’s using the product propert y of exponents and
adding the exponents. This is shown in the following example s. 
Example 228.
(4.7× 10− 3)(6.1 × 109)Deal with numbers and 10′sseparately
(4.7)(6.1 ) =28.67 Multiply numbers
2.867× 101Convert this number into scientiﬁc notation
10110− 3109=107Use product rule ,add exponents ,using 101from conversion
2.867× 107Our Solution
World View Note: Archimedes (287 BC - 212 BC), the Greek mathematician, 
developed a system for representing large numbers using a sy stem very similar to
scientiﬁc notation. He used his system to calculate the numb er of grains of sand it
would take to ﬁll the universe. His conclusion was 1063grains of sand because he
ﬁgured the universe to have a diameter of 1014stadia or about 2 light years.

Polynomials - Introduction to Polynomials
Objective: Evaluate, add, and subtract polynomials.
Many applications in mathematics have to do with what are cal led polynomials. 
Polynomials are made up of terms. Terms are a product of numbers and/or vari-
ables. For example, 5x, 2y2, − 5, ab3c, and xare all terms. Terms are connected
to each other by addition or subtraction. Expressions are of ten named based on
the number of terms in them. A monomial has one term, such as 3x2. Abino-
mial has two terms, such as a2− b2. A Trinomial has three terms, such as ax2+
bx+c. The term polynomial means many terms. Monomials, binomials, trino-
mials, and expressions with more terms all fall under the umb rella of “polyno-
mials”. 
If we know what the variable in a polynomial represents we can replace the vari-
able with the number and evaluate the polynomial as shown in t he following
example. 
Example 230.
2x2− 4x+6whenx=− 4Replace variable xwith− 4
2(− 4)2− 4(− 4) +6 Exponents ﬁrst
2(16)− 4(− 4) +6 Multiplication (we can do all terms at once )
32+16+6 Add
54 Our Solution
It is important to be careful with negative variables and exp onents. Remember
the exponent only eﬀects the number it is physically attache d to. This means − 
32=− 9because the exponent is only attached to the 3. Also, (− 3)2= 9because
the exponent is attached to the parenthesis and eﬀects every thing inside. When
we replace a variable with parenthesis like in the previous e xample, the substi-
tuted value is in parenthesis. So the (− 4)2=16 in the example. However, con-
sider the next example. 
Example 231.
− x2+ 2x+6whenx=3 Replace variable xwith3
− (3)2+2(3) +6 Exponent only on the 3,not negative
− 9 +2(3) +6 Multiply
− 9+6 +6 Add
3Our Solution
192World View Note: Ada Lovelace in 1842 described a Diﬀerence Engine that
would be used to caluclate values of polynomials. Her work be came the founda-
tion for what would become the modern computer (the programm ing language
Ada was named in her honor), more than 100 years after her deat h from cancer. 
Generally when working with polynomials we do not know the va lue of the vari-
able, so we will try and simplify instead. The simplest opera tion with polynomials
is addition. When adding polynomials we are mearly combinin g like terms. Con-
sider the following example
Example 232.
(4x3− 2x+8) +(3 x3− 9x2− 11 )Combine like terms 4x3+ 3x3and8− 11 
7x3− 9x2− 2x− 3Our Solution
Generally ﬁnal answers for polynomials are written so the ex ponent on the vari-
able counts down. Example 3 demonstrates this with the expon ent counting down
3, 2, 1, 0 (recall x0= 1 ). Subtracting polynomials is almost as fast. One extra step
comes from the minus in front of the parenthesis. When we have a negative in
front of parenthesis we distribute it through, changing the signs of everything
inside. The same is done for the subtraction sign. 
Example 233.
(5x2− 2x+7)− (3x2+6x− 4) Distribute negative through second part
5x2− 2x+7− 3x2− 6x+ 4 Combine like terms 5x2− 3x3,− 2x− 6x,and7+4
2x2− 8x+11 Our Solution
Addition and subtraction can also be combined into the same p roblem as shown
in this ﬁnal example. 
Example 234.
(2x2− 4x+3) +(5 x2− 6x+ 1)− (x2− 9x+8) Distribute negative through
2x2− 4x+ 3+5 x2− 6x+1 − x2+9x− 8Combine like terms

Polynomials - Multiplying Polynomials
Objective: Multiply polynomials.
Multiplying polynomials can take several diﬀerent forms ba sed on what we are
multiplying. We will ﬁrst look at multiplying monomials, th en monomials by
polynomials and ﬁnish with polynomials by polynomials. 
Multiplying monomials is done by multiplying the numbers or coeﬃcients and
then adding the exponents on like factors. This is shown in th e next example. 
Example 235.
(4x3y4z)(2x2y6z3)Multiply numbers and add exponents for x, y, andz
8x5y10z4Our Solution
In the previous example it is important to remember that the zhas an exponent
of 1 when no exponent is written. Thus for our answer the zhas an exponent of
1 + 3 = 4 . Be very careful with exponents in polynomials. If we are add ing or sub-
tracting the exponnets will stay the same, but when we multip ly (or divide) the
exponents will be changing. 
Next we consider multiplying a monomial by a polynomial. We h ave seen this
operation before with distributing through parenthesis. H ere we will see the exact
same process. 
Example 236.
4x3(5x2− 2x+5) Distribute the 4x3,multiplying numbers ,adding exponents
20x5− 8x4+20x3Our Solution
Following is another example with more variables. When dist ributing the expo-
nents on aare added and the exponents on bare added. 
Example 237.
2a3b(3ab2− 4a)Distribute ,multiplying numbers and adding exponents
6a4b3− 8a4bOur Solution
There are several diﬀerent methods for multiplying polynom ials. All of which
work, often students prefer the method they are ﬁrst taught. Here three methods
will be discussed. All three methods will be used to solve the same two multipli-
cation problems. 
Multiply by Distributing
196Just as we distribute a monomial through parenthesis we can d istribute an entire
polynomial. As we do this we take each term of the second polyn omial and put it
in front of the ﬁrst polynomial. 
Example 238.
(4x+ 7y)(3x− 2y)Distribute (4x+ 7y)through parenthesis
3x(4x+ 7y)− 2y(4x+ 7y)Distribute the 3xand− 2y
12x2+21 xy− 8xy− 14y2Combine like terms 21 xy− 8xy
12x2+13xy− 14y2Our Solution
This example illustrates an important point, the negative/ subtraction sign stays
with the 2y. Which means on the second step the negative is also distribu ted
through the last set of parenthesis. 
Multiplying by distributing can easily be extended to probl ems with more terms. 
First distribute the front parenthesis onto each term, then distribute again! 
Example 239.
(2x− 5)(4x2− 7x+3) Distribute (2x− 5)through parenthesis
4x2(2x− 5)− 7x(2x− 5)+3(2x− 5) Distributeagainthrougheachparenthesis
8x3− 20x2− 14x2+35x+6x− 15 Combine like terms
8x3− 34x2+41 x− 15 Our Solution
This process of multiplying by distributing can easily be re versed to do an impor-
tant procedure known as factoring. Factoring will be addres sed in a future lesson. 
Multiply by FOIL
Another form of multiplying is known as FOIL. Using the FOIL m ethod we mul-
tiply each term in the ﬁrst binomial by each term in the second binomial. The
letters of FOIL help us remember every combination. F stands for First, we mul-
tiply the ﬁrst term of each binomial. O stand for Outside, we m ultiply the outside
two terms. I stands for Inside, we multiply the inside two ter ms. L stands for
Last, we multiply the last term of each binomial. This is show n in the next
example: 
Example 240.
(4x+7y)(3x− 2y)Use FOIL to multiply
(4x)(3x) =12x2F− First terms (4x)(3x)
(4x)(− 2y)=− 8xy O − Outside terms (4x)(− 2y)
(7y)(3x)=21 xy I − Inside terms (7y)(3x)
(7y)(− 2y)=− 14y2L− Last terms (7y)(− 2y)
12x2− 8xy+21 xy− 14y2Combine like terms − 8xy+21 xy
12x2+13xy− 14y2Our Solution
197Some students like to think of the FOIL method as distributin g the ﬁrst term 4x
through the (3x− 2y)and distributing the second term 7ythrough the (3x− 2y). 
Thinking about FOIL in this way makes it possible to extend th is method to
problems with more terms. 
Example 241.
(2x− 5)(4x2− 7x+ 3) Distribute 2xand− 5
(2x)(4x2)+ (2x)(−7x)+ (2x)(3)−5(4x2)−5(−7x)−5(3) Multiply out each term
8x3− 14x2+ 6x− 20x2+35x− 15 Combine like terms
8x3− 34x2+41 x− 15 Our Solution
The second step of the FOIL method is often not written, for ex ample, consider
the previous example, a student will often go from the proble m(4x+ 7y)(3x− 2y)
and do the multiplication mentally to come up with 12 x2− 8xy+21 xy− 14y2and
then combine like terms to come up with the ﬁnal solution. 
Multiplying in rows
A third method for multiplying polynomials looks very simil ar to multiplying
numbers. Consider the problem: 
35
× 27
245 Multiply 7by5then3
700 Use0for placeholder ,multiply 2by5then3
945 Add to get Our Solution
World View Note: The ﬁrst known system that used place values comes from
Chinese mathematics, dating back to 190 AD or earlier. 
The same process can be done with polynomials. Multiply each term on the
bottom with each term on the top. 
Example 242.
(4x+ 7y)(3x− 2y)Rewrite as vertical problem
4x+ 7y
× 3x− 2y
− 8xy− 14y2Multiply − 2yby7ythen4x
12x2+21 xy Multiply 3xby7ythen4x. Line up like terms
12x2+13xy− 14y2Add like terms to get Our Solution
This same process is easily expanded to a problem with more te rms. 
198Example 243.
(2x− 5)(4x2− 7x+3) Rewrite as vertical problem
4x3− 7x+3 Put polynomial with most terms on top
× 2x− 5
− 20x2+35x− 15 Multiply − 5by each term
8x3− 14x2+ 6x Multiply 2xby each term . Line up like terms
8x3− 34x2+41 x− 15 Add like terms to get our solution
This method of multiplying in rows also works with multiplyi ng a monomial by a
polynomial! 
Any of the three described methods work to multiply polynomi als. It is suggested
that you are very comfortable with at least one of these metho ds as you work
through the practice problems. All three methods are shown s ide by side in the
example. 
Example 244.
(2x− y)(4x− 5y)
Distribute FOIL Rows
4x(2x− y)− 5y(2x− y) 2x(4x)+2x(− 5y)− y(4x)− y(− 5y) 2 x− y
8x2− 4xy− 10xy− 5y28x2− 10xy− 4xy+5y2× 4x− 5y
8x2− 14xy− 5y28x2− 14xy+5y2− 10xy+ 5y2
8x2− 4xy
8x2− 14xy+ 5y2
When we are multiplying a monomial by a polynomial by a polyno mial we can
solve by ﬁrst multiplying the polynomials then distributin g the coeﬃcient last. 
This is shown in the last example. 
Example 245.
3(2x− 4)(x+5) Multiply the binomials ,we will use FOIL
3(2x2+10x− 4x− 20)Combine like terms
3(2x2+6x− 20)Distribute the 3
6x2+18x− 60 Our Solution
A common error students do is distribute the three at the star t into both paren-
thesis. While we can distribute the 3 into the (2x− 4)factor, distributing into
both would be wrong. Be careful of this error. This is why it is suggested to mul-
tiply the binomials ﬁrst, then distribute the coeﬃenct last .

Polynomials - Multiply Special Products
Objective: Recognize and use special product rules of a sum a nd diﬀer-
ence and perfect squares to multiply polynomials.
There are a few shortcuts that we can take when multiplying po lynomials. If we
can recognize them the shortcuts can help us arrive at the sol ution much quicker. 
These shortcuts will also be useful to us as our study of algeb ra continues. 
The ﬁrst shortcut is often called a sum and a diﬀerence . A sum and a diﬀer-
ence is easily recognized as the numbers and variables are ex actly the same, but
the sign in the middle is diﬀerent (one sum, one diﬀerence). T o illustrate the
shortcut consider the following example, multiplied by the distributing method. 
Example 246.
(a+b)(a− b)Distribute (a+b)
a(a+b)− b(a+b)Distribute aand− b
a2+ab− ab− b2Combine like terms ab− ab
a2− b2Our Solution
The important part of this example is the middle terms subtra cted to zero. 
Rather than going through all this work, when we have a sum and a diﬀerence we
will jump right to our solution by squaring the ﬁrst term and s quaring the last
term, putting a subtraction between them. This is illustrat ed in the following
example
Example 247.
(x− 5)(x+ 5) Recognize sum and diﬀerence
x2− 25 Square both ,put subtraction between . Our Solution
This is much quicker than going through the work of multiplyi ng and combining
like terms. Often students ask if they can just multiply out u sing another method
and not learn the shortcut. These shortcuts are going to be ve ry useful when we
get to factoring polynomials, or reversing the multiplicat ion process. For this
reason it is very important to be able to recognize these shor tcuts. More examples
are shown here. 
201 Example 248.
(3x+7)(3 x− 7) Recognize sum and diﬀerence
9x2− 49 Square both ,put subtraction between . Our Solution
Example 249.
(2x− 6y)(2x+ 6y)Recognize sum and diﬀerence
4x2− 36y2Square both ,put subtraction between . Our Solution
It is interesting to note that while we can multiply and get an answer like a2− b2
(with subtraction), it is impossible to multiply real numbe rs and end up with a
product such as a2+b2(with addition). 
Another shortcut used to multiply is known as a perfect square . These are easy
to recognize as we will have a binomial with a 2in the exponent. The following
example illustrates multiplying a perfect square
Example 250.
(a+b)2Squared is same as multiplying by itself
(a+b)(a+b)Distribute (a+b)
a(a+b)+b(a+b)Distribute again through ﬁnal parenthesis
a2+ab+ab+b2Combine like terms ab+ab
a2+ 2ab+b2Our Solution
This problem also helps us ﬁnd our shortcut for multiplying. The ﬁrst term in the
answer is the square of the ﬁrst term in the problem. The middl e term is 2 times
the ﬁrst term times the second term. The last term is the squar e of the last term. 
This can be shortened to square the ﬁrst, twice the product, s quare the last. If we
can remember this shortcut we can square any binomial. This i s illustrated in the
following example
Example 251.
(x− 5)2Recognize perfect square
x2Square the ﬁrst
2(x)(− 5)=− 10xTwice the product
(− 5)2=25 Square the last
x2− 10x+25 Our Solution
202Be very careful when we are squaring a binomial to NOT distribute the square
through the parenthesis. A common error is to do the followin g: (x− 5)2=x2− 25
(orx2+25). Notice both of these are missing the middle term, − 10x. This is
why it is important to use the shortcut to help us ﬁnd the corre ct solution. 
Another important observation is that the middle term in the solution always has
the same sign as the middle term in the problem. This is illust rated in the next
examples. 
Example 252.
(2x+5)2Recognize perfect square
(2x)2= 4x2Square the ﬁrst
2(2x)(5) = 20xTwice the product
52=25 Square the last
4x2+20x+25 Our Solution
Example 253.
(3x− 7y)2Recognize perfect square
9x2− 42xy+49y2Square the ﬁrst ,twice the product ,square the last . Our Solution
Example 254.
(5a+ 9b)2Recognize perfect square
25a2+90ab+81 b2Square the ﬁrst ,twice the product ,square the last . Our Solution
These two formulas will be important to commit to memory. The more familiar
we are with them, the easier factoring, or multiplying in rev erse, will be. The ﬁnal
example covers both types of problems (two perfect squares, one positive, one
negative), be sure to notice the diﬀerence between the examp les and how each for-
mula is used
Example 255.
(4x− 7)(4x+7) (4 x+7)2(4x− 7)2
16x2− 49 16 x2+56x+49 16 x2− 56x+49
World View Note: There are also formulas for higher powers of binomials as
well, such as (a+b)3=a3+ 3a2b+ 3ab2+b3. While French mathematician Blaise
Pascal often gets credit for working with these expansions o f binomials in the 17th
century, Chinese mathematicians had been working with them almost 400 years
earlier!

Polynomials - Divide Polynomials
Objective: Divide polynomials using long division.
Dividing polynomials is a process very similar to long divis ion of whole numbers. 
But before we look at that, we will ﬁrst want to be able to maste r dividing a
polynomial by a monomial. The way we do this is very similar to distributing, 
but the operation we distribute is the division, dividing ea ch term by the mono-
mial and reducing the resulting expression. This is shown in the following exam-
ples
Example 256.
9x5+6x4− 18x3− 24x2
3x2Divide each term in the numerator by 3x2
9x5
3x2+6x4
3x2− 18x3
3x2− 24x2
3x2Reduce each fraction ,subtracting exponents
3x3+ 2x2− 6x− 8Our Solution
Example 257.
8x3+4x2− 2x+ 6
4x2Divide each term in the numerator by 4x2
8x3
4x2+4x2
4x2− 2x
4x2+6
4x2Reduce each fraction ,subtracting exponents
Remember negative exponents are moved to denominator
2x+1 − 1 
2x+3
2x2Our Solution
The previous example illustrates that sometimes we will hav e fractions in our
solution, as long as they are reduced this will be correct for our solution. Also
interesting in this problem is the second term4x2
4x2divided out completely. 
Remember that this means the reduced answer is 1 not 0. 
Long division is required when we divide by more than just a mo nomial. Long
division with polynomials works very similar to long divisi on with whole numbers. 
205An example is given to review the (general) steps that are use d with whole num-
bers that we will also use with polynomials
Example 258.
4| 631 Divide front numbers : 6
4= 1 /#09

4| 631 Multiply this number by divisor :1 · 4 =4
− 4 Change the sign of this number (make it subtract )and combine
23 Bring down next number

23 Multiply this number by divisor :5· 4 =20

31 Multiply this number by divisor :7· 4 =28
− 28 Change the sign of this number (make it subtract )and combine
3We will write our remainder as afraction ,over the divisor ,added to the end
1573
4Our Solution
This same process will be used to multiply polynomials. The o nly diﬀerence is we
will replace the word “number” with the word “term”
Dividing Polynomials
1. Divide front terms
2. Multiply this term by the divisor
2063. Change the sign of the terms and combine
4. Bring down the next term
5. Repeat
Step number 3 tends to be the one that students skip, not chang ing the signs of
the terms would be equivalent to adding instead of subtracti ng on long division
with whole numbers. Be sure not to miss this step! This proces s is illustrated in
the following two examples.

In both of the previous example the dividends had the exponen ts on our variable
counting down, no exponent skipped, third power, second pow er, ﬁrst power, zero
power (remember x0= 1 so there is no variable on zero power). This is very
important in long division, the variables must count down an d no exponent can
be skipped. If they don’t count down we must put them in order. If an exponent
is skipped we will have to add a term to the problem, with zero f or its coeﬃcient. 
This is demonstrated in the following example.

2x2− 6x+14 Our Solution
It is important to take a moment to check each problem to verif y that the expo-
nents count down and no exponent is skipped. If so we will have to adjust the
problem. Also, this ﬁnal example illustrates, just as in reg ular long division, 
sometimes we have no remainder in a problem. 
World View Note: Paolo Ruﬃni was an Italian Mathematician of the early
19th century. In 1809 he was the ﬁrst to describe a process cal led synthetic divi-
sion which could also be used to divide polynomials.

Factoring - Greatest Common Factor
Objective: Find the greatest common factor of a polynomial a nd factor
it out of the expression.
The opposite of multiplying polynomials together is factor ing polynomials. There
are many beniﬁts of a polynomial being factored. We use facto red polynomials to
help us solve equations, learn behaviors of graphs, work wit h fractions and more. 
Because so many concepts in algebra depend on us being able to factor polyno-
mials it is very important to have very strong factoring skil ls. 
In this lesson we will focus on factoring using the greatest c ommon factor or GCF
of a polynomial. When we multiplied polynomials, we multipl ied monomials by
polynomials by distributing, solving problems such as 4x2(2x2− 3x+ 8) = 8 x4− 
12x3+32x. In this lesson we will work the same problem backwards. We wi ll
start with 8x2− 12x3+32xand try and work backwards to the 4x2(2x− 3x+8). 
To do this we have to be able to ﬁrst identify what is the GCF of a polynomial. 
We will ﬁrst introduce this by looking at ﬁnding the GCF of sev eral numbers. To
ﬁnd a GCF of sevearal numbers we are looking for the largest nu mber that can be
divided by each of the numbers. This can often be done with qui ck mental math
and it is shown in the following example
Example 262.
Find the GCF of 15 ,24,and 27
15
3=5,24
3= 6,27
3=9 Each of the numbers can be divided by 3
GCF=3 Our Solution
When there are variables in our problem we can ﬁrst ﬁnd the GCF of the num-
212bers using mental math, then we take any variables that are in common with each
term, using the lowest exponent. This is shown in the next exa mple
Example 263.
GCF of 24 x4y2z,18x2y4,and 12 x3yz5
24
6=4,18
6=3,12
6= 2 Each number can be divided by 6
x2y x andyare in all 3,using lowest exponets
GCF= 6x2yOur Solution
To factor out a GCF from a polynomial we ﬁrst need to identify t he GCF of all
the terms, this is the part that goes in front of the parenthes is, then we divide
each term by the GCF, the answer is what is left inside the pare nthesis. This is
shown in the following examples
Example 264.
4x2− 20x+16 GCF is 4,divide each term by 4
4x2
4=x2,− 20x
4=− 5x,16
4=4 This is what is left inside the parenthesis
4(x2− 5x+4) Our Solution
With factoring we can always check our solutions by multiply ing (distributing in
this case) out the answer and the solution should be the origi nal equation. 
Example 265.
25x4− 15x3+20x2GCF is 5x2,divide each term by this
25x4
5x2= 5x2,− 15x3
5x2=− 3x,20x2
5x2= 4 This is what is left inside the parenthesis
5x2(5x2− 3x+ 4) Our Solution
Example 266.
3x3y2z+ 5x4y3z5− 4xy4GCF is xy2,divide each term by this
2133x3y2z
xy2=3x2z,5x4y3z5
xy2= 5x3yz5,−4xy4
xy2=−4y2This is what is left in parenthesis
xy2(3x2z+5x3yz5− 4y2)Our Solution
World View Note: The ﬁrst recorded algorithm for ﬁnding the greatest
common factor comes from Greek mathematician Euclid around the year 300 BC! 
Example 267.
21 x3+14x2+ 7xGCF is 7x,divide each term by this
21 x3
7x= 3x2,14x2
7x= 2x,7x
7x=1 This is what is left inside the parenthesis
7x(3x2+ 2x+1) Our Solution
It is important to note in the previous example, that when the GCF was 7xand
7xwas one of the terms, dividing gave an answer of 1. Students of ten try to
factor out the 7xand get zero which is incorrect, factoring will never make te rms
dissapear. Anything divided by itself is 1, be sure to not for get to put the 1 into
the solution. 
Often the second line is not shown in the work of factoring the GCF. We can
simply identify the GCF and put it in front of the parenthesis as shown in the fol-
lowing two examples. 
Example 268.
12x5y2− 6x4y4+8x3y5GCF is 2x3y2,put this in front of parenthesis and divide
2x3y2(6x2− 3xy2+4y3)Our Solution
Example 269.
18a4b3− 27a3b3+ 9a2b3GCF is 9a2b3,divide each term by this
9a2b3(2a2− 3a+1) Our Solution
Again, in the previous problem, when dividing 9a2b3by itself, the answer is 1, not
zero. Be very careful that each term is accounted for in your ﬁ nal solution.

Factoring - Grouping
Objective: Factor polynomials with four terms using groupi ng.
The ﬁrst thing we will always do when factoring is try to facto r out a GCF. This
GCF is often a monomial like in the problem 5xy+10xzthe GCF is the mono-
mial5x, so we would have 5x(y+ 2z). However, a GCF does not have to be a
monomial, it could be a binomial. To see this, consider the fo llowing two example. 
Example 270.
3ax− 7bx Both have xin common ,factor it out
x(3a− 7b)Our Solution
Now the same problem, but instead of xwe have (2a+ 5b). 
Example 271.
3a(2a+ 5b)− 7b(2a+ 5b)Both have (2a+5b)in common ,factor it out
(2a+5b)(3a− 7b)Our Solution
In the same way we factored out a GCF of xwe can factor out a GCF which is a
binomial, (2a+ 5b). This process can be extended to factor problems where there
is no GCF to factor out, or after the GCF is factored out, there is more factoring
that can be done. Here we will have to use another strategy to f actor. We will use
a process known as grouping. Grouping is how we will factor if there are four
terms in the problem. Remember, factoring is like multiplyi ng in reverse, so ﬁrst
we will look at a multiplication problem and then try to rever se the process. 
Example 272.
(2a+ 3)(5 b+2) Distribute (2a+3)into second parenthesis
5b(2a+3)+ 2(2 a+3) Distribute each monomial
10ab+15b+ 4a+6 Our Solution
The solution has four terms in it. We arrived at the solution b y looking at the
two parts, 5b(2a+ 3) and2(2a+ 3). When we are factoring by grouping we will
always divide the problem into two parts, the ﬁrst two terms a nd the last two
terms. Then we can factor the GCF out of both the left and right sides. When we
do this our hope is what is left in the parenthesis will match o n both the left and
right. If they match we can pull this matching GCF out front, p utting the rest in
parenthesis and we will be factored. The next example is the s ame problem
worked backwards, factoring instead of multiplying. 
216Example 273.
10ab+15b+ 4a+ 6 Split problem into two groups
10ab+15b+ 4a+ 6 GCF on left is 5b,on the right is 2
5b(2a+ 3) + 2(2a+ 3) (2a+ 3)is the same ! Factor out this GCF
(2a+3)(5 b+ 2) Our Solution
The key for grouping to work is after the GCF is factored out of the left and
right, the two binomials must match exactly. If there is any d iﬀerence between
the two we either have to do some adjusting or it can’t be facto red using the
grouping method. Consider the following example. 
Example 274.
6x2+9xy− 14x− 21 ySplit problem into two groups
6x2+ 9xy− 14x− 21 y GCF on left is 3x,on right is 7
3x(2x+3y)+7(− 2x− 3y) The signs in the parenthesis don′tmatch ! 
when the signs don’t match on both terms we can easily make the m match by fac-
toring the opposite of the GCF on the right side. Instead of 7we will use − 7. 
This will change the signs inside the second parenthesis. 
3x(2x+ 3y)− 7(2x+ 3y)(2x+ 3y)is the same ! Factor out this GCF
(2x+ 3y)(3x− 7) Our Solution
Often we can recognize early that we need to use the opposite o f the GCF when
factoring. If the ﬁrst term of the ﬁrst binomial is positive i n the problem, we will
also want the ﬁrst term of the second binomial to be positive. If it is negative
then we will use the opposite of the GCF to be sure they match. 
Example 275.
5xy− 8x− 10y+16 Split the problem into two groups
5xy− 8x− 10y+16 GCF on left is x,on right we need anegative ,
so we use − 2
x(5y− 8)− 2(5y− 8) (5y− 8)is the same ! Factor out this GCF
(5y− 8)(x− 2) Our Solution
217Sometimes when factoring the GCF out of the left or right side there is no GCF
to factor out. In this case we will use either the GCF of 1 or − 1 . Often this is all
we need to be sure the two binomials match. 
Example 276.
12ab− 14a− 6b+7 Split the problem into two groups
12ab− 14a− 6b+7 GCF on left is 2a,on right ,no GCF ,use− 1 
2a(6b− 7)− 1(6b− 7) (6b− 7)is the same ! Factor out this GCF
(6b− 7)(2a− 1) Our Solution
Example 277.
6x3− 15x2+2x− 5Split problem into two groups
6x3− 15x2+ 2x− 5 GCF on left is 3x2,on right ,no GCF ,use1 
3x2(2x− 5)+ 1(2x− 5) (2x− 5)is the same ! Factor out this GCF
(2x− 5)(3x2+1) Our Solution
Another problem that may come up with grouping is after facto ring out the GCF
on the left and right, the binomials don’t match, more than ju st the signs are dif-
ferent. In this case we may have to adjust the problem slightl y. One way to do
this is to change the order of the terms and try again. To do thi s we will move
the second term to the end of the problem and see if that helps u s use grouping. 
Example 278.
4a2− 21 b3+6ab− 14ab2Split the problem into two groups
4a2− 21 b3+6ab− 14ab2GCF on left is 1 ,on right is 2ab
1(4a2− 21 b3)+ 2ab(3− 7b) Binomials don′tmatch ! Move second term to end
4a2+ 6ab− 14ab2− 21 b3Start over ,split the problem into two groups
4a2+ 6ab− 14ab2− 21 b3GCF on left is 2a,on right is − 7b2
2a(2a+3b)− 7b2(2a+3b)(2a+3b)is the same ! Factor out this GCF
(2a+ 3b)(2a− 7b2)Our Solution
When rearranging terms the problem can still be out of order. Sometimes after
factoring out the GCF the terms are backwards. There are two w ays that this can
happen, one with addition, one with subtraction. If it happe ns with addition, for
218example the binomials are (a+b)and(b+a), we don’t have to do any extra
work. This is because addition is the same in either order ( 5 +3= 3+5 =8 ). 
Example 279.
7 +y− 3xy− 21 xSplit the problem into two groups
7+y− 3xy− 21 x GCF on left is 1 ,on the right is − 3x
1(7+ y)− 3x(y+ 7) y+ 7and7+yare the same ,use either one
(y+ 7)(1 − 3x)Our Solution
However, if the binomial has subtraction, then we need to be a bit more careful. 
For example, if the binomials are (a− b)and(b− a), we will factor out the oppo-
site of the GCF on one part, usually the second. Notice what ha ppens when we
factor out − 1 . 
Example 280.
(b− a)Factor out − 1 
− 1(− b+a)Addition can be in either order ,switch order
− 1(a− b)The order of the subtraction has been switched ! 
Generally we won’t show all the above steps, we will simply fa ctor out the oppo-
site of the GCF and switch the order of the subtraction to make it match the
other binomial. 
Example 281.
8xy− 12y+15− 10xSplit the problem into two groups
8xy− 12y15− 10x GCF on left is 4y,on right ,5
4y(2x− 3)+5(3− 2x) Need to switch subtraction order ,use− 5in middle
4y(2y− 3)− 5(2x− 3) Now2x− 3match on both ! Factor out this GCF
(2x− 3)(4y− 5) Our Solution

Factoring - Trinomials where a = 1 
Objective: Factor trinomials where the coeﬃcient of x2is one.
Factoring with three terms, or trinomials, is the most impor tant type of factoring
to be able to master. As factoring is multiplication backwar ds we will start with a
multipication problem and look at how we can reverse the proc ess. 
Example 282.
(x+6)(x− 4) Distribute (x+6)through second parenthesis
x(x+ 6)− 4(x+6) Distribute each monomial through parenthesis
x2+6x− 4x− 24 Combine like terms
x2+2x− 24 Our Solution
You may notice that if you reverse the last three steps the pro cess looks like
grouping. This is because it is grouping! The GCF of the left t wo terms is xand
the GCF of the second two terms is − 4. The way we will factor trinomials is to
make them into a polynomial with four terms and then factor by grouping. This
is shown in the following example, the same problem worked ba ckwards
Example 283.
x2+ 2x− 24 Split middle term into +6x− 4x
x2+6x− 4x− 24 Grouping : GCF on left is x,on right is − 4
x(x+ 6)− 4(x+6) ( x+ 6)is the same ,factor out this GCF
(x+6)(x− 4) Our Solution
The trick to make these problems work is how we split the middl e term. Why did
we pick + 6x− 4xand not + 5x− 3x? The reason is because 6x− 4xis the only
combination that works! So how do we know what is the one combi nation that
works? To ﬁnd the correct way to split the middle term we will u se what is called
the ac method. In the next lesson we will discuss why it is call ed the ac method. 
The way the ac method works is we ﬁnd a pair of numers that multi ply to a cer-
tain number and add to another number. Here we will try to mult iply to get the
last term and add to get the coeﬃcient of the middle term. In th e previous
221 example that would mean we wanted to multiply to − 24 and add to + 2. The
only numbers that can do this are 6and− 4( 6· − 4 =− 24 and 6 + (− 4) = 2) . 
This process is shown in the next few examples
Example 284.
x2+9x+18 Want to multiply to 18 ,add to 9
x2+ 6x+3x+186and3,split the middle term
x(x+6)+ 3( x+6) Factor by grouping
(x+ 6)(x+3) Our Solution
Example 285.
x2− 4x+3 Want to multiply to 3,add to − 4
x2− 3x− x+3 − 3and− 1 ,split the middle term
x(x− 3)− 1(x− 3) Factor by grouping
(x− 3)(x− 1) Our Solution
Example 286.
x2− 8x− 20 Want to multiply to − 20,add to − 8
x2− 10x+ 2x− 20− 10 and 2,split the middle term
x(x− 10)+ 2(x− 10)Factor by grouping
(x− 10)(x+ 2) Our Solution
Often when factoring we have two variables. These problems s olve just like prob-
lems with one variable, using the coeﬃcients to decide how to split the middle
term
Example 287.
a2− 9ab+14b2Want to multiply to 14 ,add to − 9
a2− 7ab− 2ab+14b2− 7and− 2,split the middle term
a(a− 7b)− 2b(a− 7b)Factor by grouping
(a− 7b)(a− 2b)Our Solution
222As the past few examples illustrate, it is very important to b e aware of negatives
as we ﬁnd the pair of numbers we will use to split the middle ter m. Consier the
following example, done incorrectly, ignoring negative si gns
Warning 288.
x2+ 5x− 6Want to multiply to 6,add5
x2+2x+ 3x− 6 2 and3,split the middle term
x(x+ 2)+ 3( x− 2) Factor by grouping
??? Binomials do not match ! 
Because we did not use the negative sign with the six to ﬁnd our pair of numbers, 
the binomials did not match and grouping was not able to work a t the end. Now
the problem will be done correctly. 
Example 289.
x2+5x− 6Want to multiply to − 6,add to 5
x2+6x− x− 6 6 and− 1 ,split the middle term
x(x+ 6)− 1(x+6) Factor by grouping
(x+6)(x− 1) Our Solution
You may have noticed a shortcut for factoring these problems . Once we identify
the two numbers that are used to split the middle term, these a re the two num-
bers in our factors! In the previous example, the numbers use d to split the middle
term were 6 and − 1 , our factors turned out to be (x+ 6)(x− 1). This pattern
does not always work, so be careful getting in the habit of usi ng it. We can use it
however, when we have no number (technically we have a 1) in fr ont of x2. In all
the problems we have factored in this lesson there is no numbe r in front of x2. If
this is the case then we can use this shortcut. This is shown in the next few
examples. 
Example 290.
x2− 7x− 18 Want to multiply to − 18,add to − 7
− 9and2,write the factors
(x− 9)(x+2) Our Solution
223Example 291.
m2− mn− 30n2Want to multiply to − 30,add to − 1 
5and− 6,write the factors ,don′tforget second variable
(m+ 5n)(m− 6n)Our Solution
It is possible to have a problem that does not factor. If there is no combination of
numbers that multiplies and adds to the correct numbers, the n we say we cannot
factor the polynomial, or we say the polynomial is prime. Thi s is shown in the fol-
lowing example. 
Example 292.
x2+2x+ 6 Want to multiply to 6,add to 2
1 · 6and2· 3Only possibilities to multiply to six ,none add to 2
Prime ,can′tfactor Our Solution
When factoring it is important not to forget about the GCF. If all the terms in a
problem have a common factor we will want to ﬁrst factor out th e GCF before we
factor using any other method. 
Example 293.
3x2− 24x+45 GCF of all terms is 3,factor this out
3(x2− 8x+15)Want to multiply to 15 ,add to − 8
− 5and− 3,write the factors
3(x− 5)(x− 3) Our Solution
Again it is important to comment on the shortcut of jumping ri ght to the factors, 
this only works if there is no coeﬃcient on x2. In the next lesson we will look at
how this process changes slightly when we have a number in fro nt of x2. Be
careful not to use this shortcut on all factoring problems!

cois Vieta in 1591 in France. He used vowels to represent vari ables we are solving
for, just as codes used letters to represent an unknown messa ge.

Factoring - Trinomials where a /#021
Objective: Factor trinomials using the ac method when the co eﬃcient
ofx2is not one.
When factoring trinomials we used the ac method to split the m iddle term and
then factor by grouping. The ac method gets it’s name from the general trinomial
equation, ax2+bx+c, where a, b, andcare the numbers in front of x2,
xand the constant at the end respectively. 
World View Note: It was French philosopher Rene Descartes who ﬁrst used let-
ters from the beginning of the alphabet to represent values w e know ( a, b, c )and
letters from the end to represent letters we don’t know and ar e solving for ( x, y,
z). 
The ac method is named ac because we multiply a· cto ﬁnd out what we want to
multiply to. In the previous lesson we always multiplied to j ustcbecause there
was no number in front of x2. This meant the number was 1 and we were multi-
plying to 1 cor just c. Now we will have a number in front of x2so we will be
looking for numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. Other tha n this, the pro-
cess will be the same. 
Example 294.
3x2+11 x+6 Multiply to acor(3)(6)= 18,add to 11 
3x2+ 9x+2x+6 The numbers are 9and2,split the middle term
3x(x+3)+ 2( x+3) Factor by grouping
(x+ 3)(3 x+2) Our Solution
When a= 1 , or no coeﬃcient in front of x2, we were able to use a shortcut, using
the numbers that split the middle term in the factors. The pre vious example illus-
trates an important point, the shortcut does not work when a /#021 . We must go
through all the steps of grouping in order to factor the probl em. 
Example 295.
8x2− 2x− 15 Multiply to acor(8)(− 15)=− 120,add to − 2
8x2− 12x+10x− 15 The numbers are − 12 and 10 ,split the middle term
4x(2x− 3)+ 5(2 x− 3) Factor by grouping
(2x− 3)(4x+5) Our Solution
226Example 296.
10x2− 27x+5 Multiply to acor(10)(5)= 50,add to − 27
10x2− 25x− 2x+5 The numbers are − 25 and − 2,split the middle term
5x(2x− 5)− 1(2x− 5) Factor by grouping
(2x− 5)(5x− 1) Our Solution
The same process works with two variables in the problem
Example 297.
4x2− xy− 5y2Multiply to acor(4)(− 5)=− 20,add to − 1 
4x2+4xy− 5xy− 5y2The numbers are 4and− 5,split the middle term
4x(x+y)− 5y(x+y)Factor by grouping
(x+y)(4x− 5y)Our Solution
As always, when factoring we will ﬁrst look for a GCF before us ing any other
method, including the ac method. Factoring out the GCF ﬁrst a lso has the added
bonus of making the numbers smaller so the ac method becomes e asier. 
Example 298.
18x3+33x2− 30xGCF= 3x,factor this out ﬁrst
3x[6x2+11 x− 10]Multiply to acor(6)(− 10)=− 60,add to 11 
3x[6x2+15x− 4x− 10]The numbers are 15 and − 4,split the middle term
3x[3x(2x+5)− 2(2x+ 5)] Factor by grouping
3x(2x+ 5)(3 x− 2) Our Solution
As was the case with trinomials when a= 1 , not all trinomials can be factored. If
there is no combinations that multiply and add correctly the n we can say the tri-
nomial is prime and cannot be factored. 
Example 299.
3x2+ 2x− 7Multiply to acor(3)(− 7)=− 21 ,add to 2
− 3(7)and− 7(3) Only two ways to multiply to − 21 ,it doesn′tadd to 2

Factoring - Factoring Special Products
Objective: Identify and factor special products including a diﬀerence of
squares, perfect squares, and sum and diﬀerence of cubes.
When factoring there are a few special products that, if we ca n recognize them, 
can help us factor polynomials. The ﬁrst is one we have seen be fore. When multi-
plying special products we found that a sum and a diﬀerence co uld multiply to a
diﬀerence of squares. Here we will use this special product t o help us factor
Diﬀerence of Squares :a2− b2= (a+b)(a− b)
If we are subtracting two perfect squares then it will always factor to the sum and
diﬀerence of the square roots. 
Example 300.
x2− 16 Subtracting two perfect squares ,the square roots are xand4
(x+ 4)(x− 4) Our Solution
Example 301.
9a2− 25b2Subtracting two perfect squares ,the square roots are 3aand5b
(3a+5b)(3a− 5b)Our Solution
It is important to note, that a sum of squares will never facto r. It is always
prime. This can be seen if we try to use the ac method to factor x2+36. 
Example 302.
x2+36 No bxterm,we use 0x. 
x2+ 0x+36 Multiply to 36 ,add to 0
1 · 36,2· 18,3· 12,4· 9,6· 6No combinations that multiply to 36 add to 0
Prime ,cannot factor Our Solution
229It turns out that a sum of squares is always prime. 
Sum of Squares :a2+b2=Prime
A great example where we see a sum of squares comes from factor ing a diﬀerence
of 4th powers. Because the square root of a fourth power is a sq uare ( a4√
=a2), 
we can factor a diﬀerence of fourth powers just like we factor a diﬀerence of
squares, to a sum and diﬀerence of the square roots. This will give us two factors, 
one which will be a prime sum of squares, and a second which wil l be a diﬀerence
of squares which we can factor again. This is shown in the foll owing examples. 
Example 303.
a4− b4Diﬀerence of squares with roots a2andb2
(a2+b2)(a2− b2)The ﬁrst factor is prime ,the second is adiﬀerence of squares ! 
(a2+b2)(a+b)(a− b)Our Solution
Example 304.
x4− 16 Diﬀerence of squares with roots x2and4
(x2+ 4)(x2− 4) The ﬁrst factor is prime ,the second is adiﬀerence of squares ! 
(x2+ 4)(x+2)(x− 2) Our Solution
Another factoring shortcut is the perfect square. We had a sh ortcut for multi-
plying a perfect square which can be reversed to help us facto r a perfect square
Perfect Square :a2+ 2ab+b2= (a+b)2
A perfect square can be diﬃcult to recognize at ﬁrst glance, b ut if we use the ac
method and get two of the same numbers we know we have a perfect square. 
Then we can just factor using the square roots of the ﬁrst and l ast terms and the
sign from the middle. This is shown in the following examples . 
Example 305.
x2− 6x+ 9 Multiply to 9,add to − 6
The numbers are − 3and− 3,the same ! Perfect square
(x− 3)2Use square roots from ﬁrst and last terms and sign from the mid dle
230Example 306.
4x2+20xy+25y2Multiply to 100 ,add to 20
The numbers are 10 and 10 ,the same ! Perfect square
(2x+ 5y)2Usesquarerootsfromﬁrstandlasttermsandsignfromthemid dle
World View Note: The ﬁrst known record of work with polynomials comes
from the Chinese around 200 BC. Problems would be written as “ three sheafs of a
good crop, two sheafs of a mediocre crop, and one sheaf of a bad crop sold for 29
dou. This would be the polynomial (trinomial) 3x+ 2y+z=29. 
Another factoring shortcut has cubes. With cubes we can eith er do a sum or a
diﬀerence of cubes. Both sum and diﬀerence of cubes have very similar factoring
formulas
Sum of Cubes :a3+b3= (a+b)(a2− ab+b2)
Diﬀerence of Cubes :a3− b3= (a− b)(a2+ab+b2)
Comparing the formulas you may notice that the only diﬀerenc e is the signs in
between the terms. One way to keep these two formulas straigh t is to think of
SOAP. S stands for Same sign as the problem. If we have a sum of c ubes, we add
ﬁrst, a diﬀerence of cubes we subtract ﬁrst. O stands for Oppo site sign. If we
have a sum, then subtraction is the second sign, a diﬀerence w ould have addition
for the second sign. Finally, AP stands for Always Positive. Both formulas end
with addition. The following examples show factoring with c ubes. 
Example 307.
m3− 27 We have cube roots mand3
(m3)(m23m9) Use formula ,use SOAP to ﬁll in signs
(m− 3)(m2+ 3m+9) Our Solution
Example 308.
125p3+8r3We have cube roots 5pand2r
(5p2r)(25p210r4r2)Use formula ,use SOAP to ﬁll in signs
(5p+ 2r)(25p2− 10r+4r2)Our Solution
The previous example illustrates an important point. When w e ﬁll in the trino-
mial’s ﬁrst and last terms we square the cube roots 5pand2r. Often students
forget to square the number in addition to the variable. Noti ce that when done
correctly, both get cubed. 
231 Often after factoring a sum or diﬀerence of cubes, students w ant to factor the
second factor, the trinomial further. As a general rule, thi s factor will always be
prime (unless there is a GCF which should have been factored o ut before using
cubes rule). 
The following table sumarizes all of the shortcuts that we ca n use to factor special
products
Factoring Special Products
Diﬀerence of Squares a2− b2= (a+b)(a− b)
Sum of Squares a2+b2=Prime
Perfect Square a2+2ab+b2= (a+b)2
Sum of Cubes a3+b3=(a+b)(a2− ab+b2)
Diﬀerence of Cubes a3− b3= (a− b)(a2+ab+b2)
As always, when factoring special products it is important t o check for a GCF
ﬁrst. Only after checking for a GCF should we be using the spec ial products. 
This is shown in the following examples
Example 309.
72x2− 2GCF is 2
2(36x2− 1) Diﬀerence of Squares ,square roots are 6xand1

Factoring - Factoring Strategy
Objective: Idenﬁty and use the correct method to factor vari ous poly-
nomials.
With so many diﬀerent tools used to factor, it is easy to get lo st as to which tool
to use when. Here we will attempt to organize all the diﬀerent factoring types we
have seen. A large part of deciding how to solve a problem is ba sed on how many
terms are in the problem. For all problem types we will always try to factor out
the GCF ﬁrst. 
Factoring Strategy (GCF First!!!!!) 
•2 terms: sum or diﬀerence of squares or cubes: 
a2− b2=(a+b)(a− b)
a2+b2=Prime
a3+b3= (a+b)(a2− ab+b2)
a3− b3=(a− b)(a2+ab+b2)
•3 terms: ac method, watch for perfect square! 
a2+ 2ab+b2= (a+b)2
Multiply to acand add to b
•4 terms: grouping
We will use the above strategy to factor each of the following examples. Here the
emphasis will be on which strategy to use rather than the step s used in that
method. 
Example 312.
4x2+56xy+196y2GCF ﬁrst ,4
4(x2+14xy+49y2)Three terms ,try ac method ,multiply to 49 ,add to 14

5x(xy+3y− 7x− 21 )Four terms ,try grouping
5x[y(x+ 3)− 7(x+ 3)] ( x+ 3)match ! 
5x(x+3)(y− 7) Our Solution
Example 314.
100x2− 400 GCF ﬁrst ,100
100(x2− 4) Two terms ,diﬀerence of squares
100(x+4)(x− 4) Our Solution
Example 315.
108x3y2− 39x2y2+ 3xy2GCF ﬁrst ,3xy2
3xy2(36x2− 13x+1) Thee terms ,ac method ,multiply to 36 ,add to − 13
3xy2(36x2− 9x− 4x+1) − 9and− 4,split middle term
3xy2[9x(4x− 1)− 1(4x− 1)] Factor by grouping
3xy2(4x− 1)(9x− 1) Our Solution
World View Note: Variables originated in ancient Greece where Aristotle wou ld
use a single capital letter to represent a number. 
Example 316.
5+625y3GCF ﬁrst ,5
5(1+ 125y3)Two terms ,sum of cubes
5(1+ 5 y)(1 − 5y+25y2)Our Solution
It is important to be comfortable and conﬁdent not just with u sing all the fac-
toring methods, but decided on which method to use. This is wh y practice is very
important!

Factoring - Solve by Factoring
Objective: Solve quadratic equation by factoring and using the zero
product rule.
When solving linear equations such as 2x− 5 =21 we can solve for the variable
directly by adding 5 and dividing by 2 to get 13. However, when we have x2(or a
higher power of x) we cannot just isolate the variable as we did with the linear
equations. One method that we can use to solve for the varaibl e is known as the
zero product rule
Zero Product Rule :Ifab= 0then either a= 0orb= 0
The zero product rule tells us that if two factors are multipl ied together and the
answer is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. We can use this to help us
solve factored polynomials as in the following example. 
Example 317.
(2x− 3)(5x+1) =0 One factor must be zero
2x− 3=0 or5x+ 1=0 Set each factor equal to zero
+3+ 3 − 1 − 1 Solve each equation
2x=3or5x=− 1 
22 55
x=3
2or− 1 
5Our Solution
For the zero product rule to work we must have factors to set eq ual to zero. This
means if the problem is not already factored we will factor it ﬁrst. 
Example 318.
4x2+x− 3=0 Factor using the ac method ,multiply to − 12,add to 1 
4x2− 3x+ 4x− 3=0 The numbers are − 3and4,split the middle term
x(4x− 3)+1(4 x− 3)=0 Factor by grouping
(4x− 3)(x+ 1)=0 One factor must be zero
4x− 3=0 orx+ 1=0 Set each factor equal to zero
237+3+ 3 − 1 − 1 Solve each equation
4x=3orx=− 1 
44
x=3
4or− 1 Our Solution
Another important part of the zero product rule is that befor e we factor, the
equation must equal zero. If it does not, we must move terms ar ound so it does
equal zero. Generally we like the x2term to be positive. 
Example 319.
x2= 8x− 15 Set equal to zero by moving terms to the left
− 8x+15− 8x+15
x2− 8x+15= 0 Factor using the ac method ,multiply to 15 ,add to − 8
(x− 5)(x− 3)= 0 The numbers are − 5and− 3
x− 5 =0 orx− 3= 0 Set each factor equal to zero
+ 5+ 5 +3+ 3 Solve each equation
x= 5orx= 3 Our Solution
Example 320.
(x− 7)(x+3)= − 9Not equal to zero ,multiply ﬁrst ,use FOIL

+ 6+6 − 2− 2Solve each equation
x=6or− 2Our Solution
Example 321.
3x2+ 4x− 5= 7x2+4x− 14 Set equal to zero by moving terms to the right
− 3x2− 4x+5− 3x2− 4x+5

− 3− 3 + 3+3 Solve each equation
2x=− 3or2x=3
2 2 22
x=− 3
2or3
2Our Solution
Most problems with x2will have two unique solutions. However, it is possible to
have only one solution as the next example illustrates. 
Example 322.
4x2=12x− 9Set equal to zero by moving terms to left
− 12x+9 − 12x+ 9
4x2− 12x+ 9=0 Factor using the ac method ,multiply to 36 ,add to − 12
(2x− 3)2=0 − 6and− 6, aperfect square ! 
2x− 3= 0 Set this factor equal to zero
+ 3+ 3 Solve the equation
2x= 3
22
x=3
2Our Solution
As always it will be important to factor out the GCF ﬁrst if we h ave one. This
GCF is also a factor and must also be set equal to zero using the zero product
rule. This may give us more than just two solution. The next fe w examples illus-
trate this. 
Example 323.
4x2= 8xSet equal to zero by moving the terms to left
− 8x− 8xBe careful ,on the right side ,they are not like terms ! 
4x2− 8x= 0 Factor out the GCF of 4x
4x(x− 2)= 0 One factor must be zero
4x= 0orx− 2= 0 Set each factor equal to zero
44 + 2+ 2 Solve each equation
x= 0or2Our Solution
239Example 324.
2x3− 14x2+24x=0 Factor out the GCF of 2x
2x(x2− 7x+12) =0 Factor with ac method ,multiply to 12 ,add to − 7
2x(x− 3)(x− 4) =0 The numbers are − 3and− 4
2x= 0orx− 3=0 orx− 4 =0 Set each factor equal to zero
22 + 3+ 3 +4 +4 Solve each equation

Example 325.
6x2+21 x− 27=0 Factor out the GCF of 3
3(2x2+7x− 9) =0 Factor with ac method ,multiply to − 18,add to 7
3(2x2+9x− 2x− 9) =0 The numbers are 9and− 2
3[x(2x+9)− 1(2x+9)] =0 Factor by grouping
3(2x+9)(x− 1) =0 One factor must be zero
3=0 or2x+ 9=0 orx− 1 =0 Set each factor equal to zero
3 /#020 − 9− 9 +1 +1 Solve each equation
2x=− 9orx=1 
22
x=− 9
2or1 Our Solution
In the previous example, the GCF did not have a variable in it. When we set this
factor equal to zero we got a false statement. No solutions co me from this factor. 
Often a student will skip setting the GCF factor equal to zero if there is no vari-
ables in the GCF. 
Just as not all polynomials cannot factor, all equations can not be solved by fac-
toring. If an equation does not factor we will have to solve it using another
method. These other methods are saved for another section. 
World View Note: While factoring works great to solve problems with x2, 
Tartaglia, in 16th century Italy, developed a method to solv e problems with x3. 
He kept his method a secret until another mathematician, Car dan, talked him out
of his secret and published the results. To this day the formu la is known as
Cardan’s Formula. 
A question often asked is if it is possible to get rid of the squ are on the variable
by taking the square root of both sides. While it is possible, there are a few prop-
erties of square roots that we have not covered yet and thus it is common to
break a rule of roots that we are not aware of at this point. The short reason we
want to avoid this for now is because taking a square root will only give us one of
the two answers. When we talk about roots we will come back to p roblems like
these and see how we can solve using square roots in a method ca lled completing
the square. For now, never take the square root of both sides!

As rational expressions are a special type of fraction, it is important to remember
with fractions we cannot have zero in the denominator of a fra ction. For this
reason, rational expressions may have one more excluded val ues, or values that
the variable cannot be or the expression would be undeﬁned. 
Example 326.
State the excluded value (s): x2− 1 
3x2+5xDenominator cannot be zero
3x2+ 5x /#020Factor
x(3x+5) /#020Set each factor not equal to zero
x /#020or3x+5 /#020Subtract 5from second equation
− 5− 5
3x /#02− 5Divide by 3
33
x /#02− 5
3Second equation is solved
x /#020or− 5
3Our Solution
This means we can use any value for xin the equation except for 0 and− 5
3. We
243can however, evaluate any other value in the expression. 
World View Note: The number zero was not widely accepted in mathematical
thought around the world for many years. It was the Mayans of C entral America
who ﬁrst used zero to aid in the use of their base 20 system as a p lace holder! 
Rational expressions are easily evaluated by simply substi tuting the value for the
variable and using order of operations. 
Example 327.
x2− 4
x2+ 6x+8when x=− 6Substitute − 5in for each variable
(− 6)2− 4
(− 6)2+ 6(− 6)+ 8Exponents ﬁrst
36− 4
36+ 6(− 6)+ 8Multiply
36− 4
36− 36+ 8Add and subtract
32
8Reduce
4Our Solution
Just as we reduced the previous example, often a rational exp ression can be
reduced, even without knowing the value of the variable. Whe n we reduce we
divide out common factors. We have already seen this with mon omials when we
discussed properties of exponents. If the problem only has m onomials we can
reduce the coeﬃcients, and subtract exponents on the variab les. 
Example 328.
15x4y2
25x2y6Reduce ,subtract exponents . Negative exponents move to denominator
3x2
5y4Our Solution
244However, if there is more than just one term in either the nume rator or denomi-
nator, we can’t divide out common factors unless we ﬁrst fact or the numerator
and denominator. 
Example 329.
28
8x2− 16Denominator has acommon factor of 8

3(3x− 1)
6(3x− 1)Divide out common factor (3x− 1)and divide 3and6by3

2Our Solution
Example 331.
x2− 25
x2+ 8x+15Numerator is diﬀerence of squares ,denominator is factored using ac
(x+ 5)(x− 5)
(x+ 3)(x+5)Divide out common factor (x+ 5)
x− 5
x+3Our Solution
It is important to remember we cannot reduce terms, only fact ors. This means if
there are any + or − between the parts we want to reduce we cannot. In the pre-
vious example we had the solutionx− 5
x+ 3, we cannot divide out the x’s because
they are terms (separated by + or − ) not factors (separated by multiplication).

Rational Expressions - Least Common Denominators
Objective: Idenﬁty the least common denominator and build u p
denominators to match this common denominator.
As with fractions, the least common denominator or LCD is ver y important to
working with rational expressions. The process we use to ﬁnd the LCD is based
on the process used to ﬁnd the LCD of intergers. 
Example 338.
Find the LCD of 8and6Consider multiples of the larger number
8,16,24 /#09. 24 is the ﬁrst multiple of 8that is also divisible by 6
24 Our Solution
When ﬁnding the LCD of several monomials we ﬁrst ﬁnd the LCD of the coeﬃ-
cients, then use all variables and attach the highest expone nt on each variable. 
Example 339.
Find the LCD of 4x2y5and6x4y3z6
First ﬁnd the LCD of coeﬃcients 4and6
12 12 is the LCD of 4and6
x4y5z6Use all variables with highest exponents on each variable
12x4y5z6Our Solution
The same pattern can be used on polynomials that have more tha n one term. 
However, we must ﬁrst factor each polynomial so we can identi fy all the factors to
be used (attaching highest exponent if necessary). 
Example 340.
Find the LCD of x2+2x− 3andx2− x− 12 Factor each polynomial
(x− 1)(x+3)and(x− 4)(x+3) LCD uses all unique factors
(x− 1)(x+ 3)(x− 4) Our Solution
Notice we only used (x+ 3) once in our LCD. This is because it only appears as a
factor once in either polynomial. The only time we need to rep eat a factor or use
an exponent on a factor is if there are exponents when one of th e polynomials is
factored
253Example 341.
Find the LCD of x2− 10x+25 and x2− 14x+45
Factor each polynomial
(x− 5)2and(x− 5)(x− 9) LCD uses all unique factors with highest exponent
(x− 5)2(x− 9) Our Solution
The previous example could have also been done with factorin g the ﬁrst polyno-
mial to (x− 5)(x− 5). Then we would have used (x− 5)twice in the LCD
because it showed up twice in one of the polynomials. However , it is the author’s
suggestion to use the exponents in factored form so as to use t he same pattern
(highest exponent) as used with monomials. 
Once we know the LCD, our goal will be to build up fractions so t hey have
matching denominators. In this lesson we will not be adding a nd subtracting frac-
tions, just building them up to a common denominator. We can b uild up a frac-
tion’s denominator by multipliplying the numerator and den oinator by any factors
that are not already in the denominator. 
Example 342.
5a
3a2b=?

Multiply numerator and denominator by missing factor ,
FOIL numerator
x2+x− 6
(x+4)(x+ 3)Our Solution
254As the above example illustrates, we will multiply out our nu merators, but keep
our denominators factored. The reason for this is to add and s ubtract fractions
we will want to be able to combine like terms in the numerator, then when we
reduce at the end we will want our denominators factored. 
Once we know how to ﬁnd the LCD and how to build up fractions to a desired
denominator we can combine them together by ﬁnding a common d enominator
and building up those fractions.

Rational Expressions - Add & Subtract
Objective: Add and subtract rational expressions with and w ithout
common denominators.
Adding and subtracting rational expressions is identical t o adding and subtracting
with integers. Recall that when adding with a common denomin ator we add the
numerators and keep the denominator. This is the same proces s used with
rational expressions. Remember to reduce, if possible, you r ﬁnal answer. 
Example 346.

x2− 2x− 8Same denominator ,add numerators ,combine like terms
2x+ 4
x2− 2x− 8Factor numerator and denominator
2(x+2)
(x+2)(x− 4)Divide out (x+2)
2
x− 4Our Solution
257Subtraction with common denominator follows the same patte rn, though the sub-
traction can cause problems if we are not careful with it. To a void sign errors we
will ﬁrst distribute the subtraction through the numerator . Then we can treat it
like an addition problem. This process is the same as “add the opposite” we saw
when subtracting with negatives. 
Example 347.
6x− 12
3x− 6− 15x− 6
3x− 6Add the opposite of the second fraction (distribute negative )
6x− 12
3x− 6+− 15x+ 6
3x− 6Add numerators ,combine like terms
− 9x− 6
3x− 6Factor numerator and denominator
− 3(3x+2)
3(x− 2)Divide out common factor of 3
− (3x+2)
x− 2Our Solution
World View Note: The Rhind papyrus of Egypt from 1650 BC gives some of
the earliest known symbols for addition and subtraction, a p air of legs walking in
the direction one reads for addition, and a pair of legs walki ng in the opposite
direction for subtraction.. 
When we don’t have a common denominator we will have to ﬁnd the least
common denominator (LCD) and build up each fraction so the de nominators
match. The following example shows this process with intege rs.

Rational Expressions - Complex Fractions
Objective: Simplify complex fractions by multiplying each term by the
least common denominator.
Complex fractions have fractions in either the numerator, o r denominator, or usu-
ally both. These fractions can be simpliﬁed in one of two ways . This will be illus-
trated ﬁrst with integers, then we will consider how the proc ess can be expanded
to include expressions with variables. 
The ﬁrst method uses order of operations to simplify the nume rator and denomi-
nator ﬁrst, then divide the two resulting fractions by multi plying by the recip-
rocal. 
Example 353.

16Our Solution
The process above works just ﬁne to simplify, but between get ting common
denominators, taking reciprocals, and reducing, it can be a very involved process. 
Generally we prefer a diﬀerent method, to multiply the numer ator and denomi-
nator of the large fraction (in eﬀect each term in the complex fraction) by the
least common denominator (LCD). This will allow us to reduce and clear the
small fractions. We will simplify the same problem using thi s second method. 
Example 354.

16Our Solution
Clearly the second method is a much cleaner and faster method to arrive at our
solution. It is the method we will use when simplifying with v ariables as well. We
will ﬁrst ﬁnd the LCD of the small fractions, and multiply eac h term by this LCD
so we can clear the small fractions and simplify.

World View Note: Sophie Germain is one of the most famous women in mathe-
matics, many primes, which are important to ﬁnding an LCD, ca rry her name. 
Germain primes are prime numbers where one more than double t he prime
number is also prime, for example 3 is prime and so is 2· 3 + 1 = 7 prime. The
largest known Germain prime (at the time of printing) is 1830 27· 2265440− 1 which
has 79911 digits! 
Some problems may require us to FOIL as we simplify. To avoid s ign errors, if
there is a binomial in the numerator, we will ﬁrst distribute the negative through
the numerator.

If there are negative exponents in an expression we will have to ﬁrst convert these
negative exponents into fractions. Remember, the exponent is only on the factor
it is attached to, not the whole term.

Once we convert each negative exponent into a fraction, the p roblem solves
exactly like the other complex fraction problems.

Rational Expressions - Proportions
Objective: Solve proportions using the cross product and us e propor-
tions to solve application problems
When two fractions are equal, they are called a proportion. T his deﬁnition can be
generalized to two equal rational expressions. Proportion s have an important
property called the cross-product. 
Cross Product :Ifa
b=c
dthen ad =bc
The cross product tells us we can multiply diagonally to get a n equation with no
fractions that we can solve. 
Example 359.
20
6=x
9Calculate cross product
268(20)(9)= 6 xMultiply
180= 6xDivide both sides by 6
66
30=xOur Solution
World View Note: The ﬁrst clear deﬁnition of a proportion and the notation
for a proportion came from the German Leibniz who wrote, “I wr itedy: x=dt: a; 
fordyis toxasdtis toa, is indeed the same as, dydivided by xis equal to dt
divided by a. From this equation follow then all the rules of proportion. ”
If the proportion has more than one term in either numerator o r denominator, we
will have to distribute while calculating the cross product . 
Example 360.
x+ 3
4=2
5Calculate cross product
5(x+3)= (4)(2) Multiply and distribute
5x+15=8 Solve
− 15− 15 Subtract 15 from both sides

This same idea can be seen when the variable appears in severa l parts of the pro-
portion.

5(2x− 3)= 2(7 x+4) Distribute
10x− 15=14x+8 Move variables to one side
− 10x − 10x Subtract 10 xfrom both sides
− 15=4x+8 Subtract 8from both sides
− 8 − 8
− 23= 4xDivide both sides by 4

4=xOur Solution
As we solve proportions we may end up with a quadratic that we w ill have to
solve. We can solve this quadratic in the same way we solved qu adratics in the
past, either factoring, completing the square or the quadra tic formula. As with
solving quadratics before, we will generally end up with two solutions. 
Example 363.

k− 2Calculate cross product
(k+ 3)(k− 2) =(8)(3) FOIL and multiply
k2+k− 6=24 Make equation equal zero
− 24− 24 Subtract 24 from both sides
k2+k− 30=0 Factor
(k+ 6)(k− 5)=0 Set each factor equal to zero
k+6 =0 ork− 5=0 Solve each equation
− 6− 6 + 5=5 Add or subtract
k=− 6ork=5 Our Solutions
Proportions are very useful in how they can be used in many diﬀ erent types of
applications. We can use them to compare diﬀerent quantitie s and make conclu-
sions about how quantities are related. As we set up these pro blems it is impor-
tant to remember to stay organized, if we are comparing dogs a nd cats, and the
number of dogs is in the numerator of the ﬁrst fraction, then t he numerator of the
second fraction should also refer to the dogs. This consiste ncy of the numerator
and denominator is essential in setting up our proportions.
Example 364.
A six foot tall man casts a shadow that is 3.5 feet long. If the s hadow of a ﬂag
pole is 8 feet long, how tall is the ﬂag pole?
shadow
heightWe will put shadows in numerator ,heights in denomintor

6The man has ashadow of 3.5 feet and aheight of 6feet
8
xThe ﬂagpole has ashadow of 8feet,but we don′tknow the height

xThis gives us our proportion ,calculate cross product
3.5x= (8)(6) Multiply
3.5x=48 Divide both sides by 3.5
3.5 3.5
x=13.7ft Our Solution
Example 365.
In a basketball game, the home team was down by 9 points at the e nd of the
game. They only scored 6 points for every 7 points the visitin g team scored. 
What was the ﬁnal score of the game?

When we solved problems like the next example, we cleared the fraction by multi-
plying by the least common denominator (LCD)

We will use the same process to solve rational equations, the only diﬀerence is our
274LCD will be more involved. We will also have to be aware of doma in issues. If our
LCD equals zero, the solution is undeﬁned. We will always che ck our solutions in
the LCD as we may have to remove a solution from our solution se t.

Rational Expressions - Dimensional Analysis
Objective: Use dimensional analysis to preform single unit , dual unit,
square unit, and cubed unit conversions.
One application of rational expressions deals with convert ing units. When we con-
vert units of measure we can do so by multiplying several frac tions together in a
process known as dimensional analysis. The trick will be to d ecide what fractions
to multiply. When multiplying, if we multiply by 1, the value of the expression
does not change. One written as a fraction can look like many d iﬀerent things as
long as the numerator and denominator are identical in value . Notice the numer-
ator and denominator are not identical in appearance, but ra ther identical in
value. Below are several fractions, each equal to one where n umerator and denom-
inator are identical in value.

1 =4
4=1
2
2
4=100cm
1 m=1 lb
16oz=1 hr
60 min=60 min
1 hr
The last few fractions that include units are called convers ion factors. We can
make a conversion factor out of any two measurements that rep resent the same
distance. For example, 1 mile = 5280 feet. We could then make a conversion
factor1mi
5280ftbecause both values are the same, the fraction is still equal to one. 
Similarly we could make a conversion factor5280ft
1mi. The trick for conversions will
279be to use the correct fractions. 
The idea behind dimensional analysis is we will multiply by a fraction in such a
way that the units we don’t want will divide out of the problem . We found out
when multiplying rational expressions that if a variable ap pears in the numerator
and denominator we can divide it out of the expression. It is t he same with units. 
Consider the following conversion. 
Example 371.
17.37 miles to feet Write 17.37 miles as afraction ,put it over 1 /parenleftbigg17.37mi
1 /parenrightbigg
To divide out the miles we need miles in the denominator
/parenleftbigg17.37mi
1 /parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg??ft
??mi/parenrightbigg
We are converting to feet ,so this will go in the numerator
/parenleftbigg17.37mi
1 /parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg5280ft
1 mi/parenrightbigg
Fill in the relationship described above ,1 mile=5280 feet
/parenleftbigg17.37
1 /parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg5280ft
1 /parenrightbigg
Divide out the miles and multiply across
91 ,713.6ft Our Solution
In the previous example, we had to use the conversion factor5280ft
1miso the miles
would divide out. If we had used1mi
5280ftwe would not have been able to divide out
the miles. This is why when doing dimensional analysis it is v ery important to
use units in the set-up of the problem, so we know how to correc tly set up the
conversion factor. 
Example 372.
If 1 pound = 16 ounces, how many pounds 435 ounces?
/parenleftbigg435oz
1 /parenrightbigg
Write 435 as afraction ,put it over 1 
/parenleftbigg435oz
1 /parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg??lbs
??oz/parenrightbigg
To divide out oz ,
put it in the denominator and lbs in numerator/parenleftbigg435oz
1 /parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg1 lbs
16oz/parenrightbigg
Fill in the given relationship ,1 pound =16 ounces
280/parenleftbigg435
1 /parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg1 lbs
16/parenrightbigg
=435 lbs
16Divide out oz ,multiply across . Divide result
27.1875 lbs Our Solution
The same process can be used to convert problems with several units in them. 
Consider the following example. 
Example 373.
A student averaged 45 miles per hour on a trip. What was the stu dent’s speed in
feet per second?
/parenleftbigg45mi

′′per′′is the fraction bar ,put hr in denominator

Divide out mi and hr . Multiply across
237600ft
3600 secDivide numbers
66 ft per sec Our Solution
If the units are two-dimensional (such as square inches - in2) or three-dimensional
(such as cubic feet - ft3) we will need to put the same exponent on the conversion
factor. So if we are converting square inches (in2) to square ft (ft2), the conversion
factor would be squared, /parenleftBig
1ft
12in/parenrightBig2
. Similarly if the units are cubed, we will cube
the convesion factor.

well.

282To focus on the process of conversions, a conversion sheet ha s been included at
the end of this lesson which includes several conversion fac tors for length, volume, 
mass and time in both English and Metric units. 
The process of dimensional analysis can be used to convert ot her types of units as
well. If we can identify relationships that represent the sa me value we can make
them into a conversion factor.

Radicals - Square Roots
Objective: Simplify expressions with square roots.
Square roots are the most common type of radical used. A squar e root “un-
squares” a number. For example, because 52=25 we say the square root of 25 is 5. 
The square root of 25 is written as 25√
. 
World View Note: The radical sign, when ﬁrst used was an R with a line
through the tail, similar to our perscription symbol today. The R came from the
latin, “radix”, which can be translated as “source” or “foun dation”. It wasn’t until
the 1500s that our current symbol was ﬁrst used in Germany (bu t even then it
was just a check mark with no bar over the numbers! 
The following example gives several square roots: 
Example 377.
1 √
= 1 121 √
=11 
4√
= 2 625√
=25
9√
= 3 − 81 √=Undeﬁned
The ﬁnal example, − 81 √is currently undeﬁned as negatives have no square root. 
This is because if we square a positive or a negative, the answ er will be positive. 
Thus we can only take square roots of positive numbers. In ano ther lesson we will
deﬁne a method we can use to work with and evaluate negative sq uare roots, but
for now we will simply say they are undeﬁned. 
Not all numbers have a nice even square root. For example, if w e found 8√
on
our calculator, the answer would be 2.8284271247461900976 03377448419... and
even this number is a rounded approximation of the square roo t. To be as accu-
rate as possible, we will never use the calculator to ﬁnd deci mal approximations of
square roots. Instead we will express roots in simplest radi cal form. We will do
this using a property known as the product rule of radicals
Product Rule of Square Roots :a· b√
=a√· b√
We can use the product rule to simplify an expression such as 3 6· 5√
by spliting
it into two roots, 36√
· 5√
, and simplifying the ﬁrst root, 6 5√
. The trick in this
288process is being able to translate a problem like 180√
into 36 · 5√
. There are sev-
eral ways this can be done. The most common and, with a bit of pr actice, the
fastest method, is to ﬁnd perfect squares that divide evenly into the radicand, or
number under the radical. This is shown in the next example. 
Example 378.

75 is divisible by 25 ,aperfect square
25· 3√
Split into factors
25√
· 3√
Product rule ,take the square root of 25
5 3√
Our Solution
If there is a coeﬃcient in front of the radical to begin with, t he problem merely
becomes a big multiplication problem. 
Example 379.

Split into factors
5 9√
· 7√
Product rule ,take the square root of 9
5· 3 7√
Multiply coeﬃcients
157√
Our Solution
As we simplify radicals using this method it is important to b e sure our ﬁnal
answer can be simpliﬁed no more. 
Example 380.

Our Solution . 
The previous example could have been done in fewer steps if we had noticed that
72=36· 2, but often the time it takes to discover the larger perfect sq uare is more
than it would take to simplify in several steps. 
Variables often are part of the radicand as well. When taking the square roots of
variables, we can divide the exponent by 2. For example, x8√
=x4, because we
divide the exponent of 8 by 2. This follows from the power of a p ower rule of
expoennts, (x4)2=x8. When squaring, we multiply the exponent by two, so when
taking a square root we divide the exponent by 2. This is shown in the following
example. 
Example 381.
− 518x4y6z10/radicalbig
18 is divisible by 9,aperfect square
− 5 9· 2x4y6z10/radicalbig

· z10√
Product rule ,simplify roots ,divide exponents by 2
− 5· 3x2y3z52√
Multiply coeﬃcients
− 15x2y3z52√
Our Solution
We can’t always evenly divide the exponent on a variable by 2. Sometimes we
have a remainder. If there is a remainder, this means the rema inder is left inside
the radical, and the whole number part is how many are outside the radical. This
is shown in the following example. 
Example 382.

20 is divisible by 4, aperfect square

Radicals - Higher Roots
Objective: Simplify radicals with an index greater than two .
While square roots are the most common type of radical we work with, we can
take higher roots of numbers as well: cube roots, fourth root s, ﬁfth roots, etc. Fol-
lowing is a deﬁnition of radicals. 
am√=bifbm=a
The small letter minside the radical is called the index. It tells us which root we
are taking, or which power we are “un-doing”. For square root s the index is 2. As
this is the most common root, the two is not usually written. 
World View Note: The word for root comes from the French mathematician
Franciscus Vieta in the late 16th century. 
The following example includes several higher roots. 
Example 383.
1253√
=5 − 643√=− 4
81 4√
= 3 − 1287√
=− 2
325√
= 2 − 164√=undeﬁned
We must be careful of a few things as we work with higher roots. First its impor-
tant not to forget to check the index on the root. 81 √
= 9but 81 4√
= 3. This is
because 92=81 and 34=81. Another thing to watch out for is negatives under
roots. We can take an odd root of a negative number, because a n egative number
raised to an odd power is still negative. However, we cannot t ake an even root of
a negative number, this we will say is undeﬁned. In a later sec tion we will discuss
how to work with roots of negative, but for now we will simply s ay they are unde-
ﬁned. 
We can simplify higher roots in much the same way we simpliﬁed square roots, 
using the product property of radicals. 
Product Property of Radicals :abm√
=am√· bm√
Often we are not as familiar with higher powers as we are with s quares. It is
important to remember what index we are working with as we try and work our
way to the solution. 
292Example 384.
543√
We are working with acubed root ,want third powers
23= 8 Test2,23=8,54 is not divisible by 8. 
33=27 Test 3,33=27,54 is divisible by 27 ! 
27· 23√
Write as factors
273√
· 23√
Product rule ,take cubed root of 27
3 23√
Our Solution
Just as with square roots, if we have a coeﬃcient, we multiply the new coeﬃcients
together. 
Example 385.
3484√
We are working with afourth root ,want fourth powers
24=16 Test 2,24=16,48 is divisible by 16 ! 
316· 34√
Write as factors
3164√
· 34√
Product rule ,take fourth root of 16
3· 2 34√
Multiply coeﬃcients
6 34√
Our Solution
We can also take higher roots of variables. As we do, we will di vide the exponent
on the variable by the index. Any whole answer is how many of th at varible will
come out of the square root. Any remainder is how many are left behind inside
the square root. This is shown in the following examples. 
Example 386.
x25y17z3 5/radicalbig
Divide each exponent by 5,whole number outside ,remainder inside
x5y3y2z3 5/radicalbig
Our Solution
In the previous example, for the x, we divided25
5= 5R0, sox5came out, no x’s
remain inside. For the y, we divided17
5= 3R2, soy3came out, and y2remains
inside. For the z, when we divided3
5= 0R3, all three or z3remained inside. The
following example includes integers in our problem.

Radicals - Adding Radicals
Objective: Add like radicals by ﬁrst simplifying each radic al.
Adding and subtracting radicals is very similar to adding an d subtracting with
variables. Consider the following example.

Notice that when we combined the terms with 11 √
it was just like combining
terms with x. When adding and subtracting with radicals we can combine li ke
radicals just as like terms. We add and subtract the coeﬃcien ts in front of the
295radical, and the radical stays the same. This is shown in the f ollowing example. 
Example 389.

We cannot simplify this expression any more as the radicals d o not match. Often
problems we solve have no like radicals, however, if we simpl ify the radicals ﬁrst
we may ﬁnd we do in fact have like radicals.

Radicals - Multiply and Divide Radicals
Objective: Multiply and divide radicals using the product a nd quotient
rules of radicals.
Multiplying radicals is very simple if the index on all the ra dicals match. The
prodcut rule of radicals which we have already been using can be generalized as
follows: 
Product Rule of Radicals :a bm√
· c dm√
=ac bdm√
Another way of stating this rule is we are allowed to multiply the factors outside
the radical and we are allowed to multiply the factors inside the radicals, as long
as the index matches. This is shown in the following example.
Example 392.

Our Solution
As we are multiplying we always look at our ﬁnal solution to ch eck if all the radi-
cals are simpliﬁed and all like radicals or like terms have be en combined. 
Division with radicals is very similar to multiplication, i f we think about division
as reducing fractions, we can reduce the coeﬃcients outside the radicals and
reduce the values inside the radicals to get our ﬁnal solutio n.

4Our Solution
There is one catch to dividing with radicals, it is considere d bad practice to have
a radical in the denominator of our ﬁnal answer. If there is a r adical in the
denominator we will rationalize it, or clear out any radical s in the denominator. 
299We do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by th e same thing. 
The problems we will consider here will all have a monomial in the denominator. 
The way we clear a monomial radical in the denominator is to fo cus on the index. 
The index tells us how many of each factor we will need to clear the radical. For
example, if the index is 4, we will need 4 of each factor to clea r the radical. This
is shown in the following examples. 
Example 398.

35Our Solution
300The previous example could have been solved by multiplying n umerator and
denominator by 252 3√
. However, this would have made the numbers very large
and we would have needed to reduce our soultion at the end. Thi s is why re-
writing the radical as 523√
and multiplying by just 53√
was the better way to sim-
plify. 
We will also always want to reduce our fractions (inside and o ut of the radical) 
before we rationalize. 
Example 401.

Radicals - Rationalize Denominators
Objective: Rationalize the denominators of radical expres sions.
It is considered bad practice to have a radical in the denomin ator of a fraction. 
When this happens we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same
thing in order to clear the radical. In the lesson on dividing radicals we talked
about how this was done with monomials. Here we will look at ho w this is done
with binomials. 
If the binomial is in the numerator the process to rationaliz e the denominator is
essentially the same as with monomials. The only diﬀerence i s we will have to dis-
tribute in the numerator. 
Example 403.
3√
− 9
2 6√ Want to clear 6√
in denominator ,multiply by 6√
( 3√
− 9)
2 6√/parenleftBigg
6√

We will distribute the 6√
through the numerator

4Our Solution
It is important to remember that when reducing the fraction w e cannot reduce
with just the 3 and 12 or just the 9 and 12. When we have addition or subtrac-
tion in the numerator or denominator we must divide all terms by the same
number. 
The problem can often be made easier if we ﬁrst simplify any ra dicals in the
problem.

3xOur Solution
As we are rationalizing it will always be important to consta ntly check our
problem to see if it can be simpliﬁed more. We ask ourselves, c an the fraction be
reduced? Can the radicals be simpliﬁed? These steps may happ en several times
on our way to the solution. 
If the binomial occurs in the denominator we will have to use a diﬀerent strategy
to clear the radical. Consider2
3√
− 5, if we were to multiply the denominator by
3√
we would have to distribute it and we would end up with 3− 5 3√
. We have
not cleared the radical, only moved it to another part of the d enominator. So our
current method will not work. Instead we will use what is call ed a conjugate. A
conjugate is made up of the same terms, with the opposite sign in the midd le. 
So for our example with 3√
− 5in the denominator, the conjugate would be 3√
+
5. The advantage of a conjugate is when we multiply them togeth er we have
( 3√
− 5)( 3√
+ 5), which is a sum and a diﬀerence. We know when we multiply
these we get a diﬀerence of squares. Squaring 3√
and 5, with subtraction in the
middle gives the product 3− 25=− 22. Our answer when multiplying conjugates
will no longer have a square root. This is exactly what we want .

Radicals - Rational Exponents
Objective: Convert between radical notation and exponenti al notation
and simplify expressions with rational exponents using the properties
of exponents.
When we simplify radicals with exponents, we divide the expo nent by the index. 
Another way to write division is with a fraction bar. This ide a is how we will
deﬁne rational exponents. 
Deﬁnition of Rational Exponents :an
m= ( am√)n
The denominator of a rational exponent becomes the index on o ur radical, like-
wise the index on the radical becomes the denominator of the e xponent. We can
use this property to change any radical expression into an ex ponential expression. 
Example 410.
(x5√
)3=x3
5( 3x6√
)5= (3x)5
6
1 
(a7√)3=a− 3
71 
(xy3√)2=(xy)− 2
3Index is denominator
Negative exponents from reciprocals
We can also change any rational exponent into a radical expre ssion by using the
denominator as the index. 
Example 411.
a5
3= (a3√)5(2mn)2
7=( 2 mn7√
)2
x− 4
5=1 
(x5√)4(xy)− 2
9=1 
(xy9√)2Index is denominator
Negative exponent means reciprocals
World View Note: Nicole Oresme, a Mathematician born in Normandy was the
ﬁrst to use rational exponents. He used the notation1
3•9pto represent 91 
3. How-
ever his notation went largely unnoticed. 
The ability to change between exponential expressions and r adical expressions
allows us to evaluate problems we had no means of evaluating b efore by changing
to a radical. 
Example 412.

81 Our solution
The largest advantage of being able to change a radical expre ssion into an expo-
nential expression is we are now allowed to use all our expone nt properties to sim-
plify. The following table reviews all of our exponent prope rties.

When adding and subtracting with fractions we need to be sure to have a
common denominator. When multiplying we only need to multip ly the numera-
tors together and denominators together. The following exa mples show several
diﬀerent problems, using diﬀerent properties to simplify t he rational exponents.

Radicals - Radicals of Mixed Index
Objective: Reduce the index on a radical and multiply or divi de radi-
cals of diﬀerent index.
Knowing that a radical has the same properties as exponents ( written as a ratio) 
allows us to manipulate radicals in new ways. One thing we are allowed to do is
reduce, not just the radicand, but the index as well. This is s hown in the fol-
lowing example. 
Example 417.
x6y2 8/radicalbig
Rewrite as rational exponent
(x6y2)1 
5Multiply exponents
x6
8y2
8Reduce each fraction
x3
4y1 
4All exponents have denominator of 4,this is our new index
x3y4/radicalbig
Our Solution
What we have done is reduced our index by dividing the index an d all the expo-
nents by the same number (2 in the previous example). If we not ice a common
factor in the index and all the exponnets on every factor we ca n reduce by
dividing by that common factor. This is shown in the next exam ple
Example 418.
a6b9c15 24√
Index and all exponents are divisible by 3
a2b3c5 8√
Our Solution
We can use the same process when there are coeﬃcients in the pr oblem. We will
ﬁrst write the coeﬃcient as an exponential expression so we c an divide the
exponet by the common factor as well. 
Example 419.
8m6n3 9√
Write 8as23
23m6n3 9√
Index and all exponents are divisible by 3
2m2n3√
Our Solution
We can use a very similar idea to also multiply radicals where the index does not
match. First we will consider an example using rational expo nents, then identify
the pattern we can use.

12a6
12b3
12Write under asingle radical with common index ,12
a4b8a6b3 12√
Add exponents
a10b11 12√
Our Solution
To combine the radicals we need a common index (just like the c ommon denomi-
nator). We will get a common index by multiplying each index a nd exponent by
an integer that will allow us to build up to that desired index . This process is
shown in the next example. 
Example 421.
a2b3 4√
a2b6√
Common index is 12 . 
Multiply ﬁrst index and exponents by 3,second by 2
a6b9a4b212√
Add exponents
a10b11 12√
Our Solution
Often after combining radicals of mixed index we will need to simplify the
resulting radical. 
Example 422.
x3y4 5/radicalbig
x2y3/radicalbig
Common index : 15. 
Multiply ﬁrst index and exponents by 3,second by 5
x9y12x10y5 15/radicalbig
Add exponents
x19y17 15/radicalbig
Simplify by dividing exponents by index ,remainder is left inside
xy x4y2 15/radicalbig
Our Solution
Just as with reducing the index, we will rewrite coeﬃcients a s exponential expres-
sions. This will also allow us to use exponent properties to s implify. 
Example 423.
4x2y3/radicalbig
8xy3 4/radicalbig
Rewrite 4as22and8as23
22x2y3/radicalbig
23xy3 4/radicalbig
Common index : 12. 
Multiply ﬁrst index and exponents by 4,second by 3
28x8y429x3y9 12/radicalbig
Add exponents (even on the 2)
217x11 y13 12/radicalbig
Simplify by dividing exponents by index ,remainder is left inside
2y25x11 y12/radicalbig
Simplify 25
2y32x11 y12/radicalbig
Our Solution
315If there is a binomial in the radical then we need to keep that b inomial together
through the entire problem. 
Example 424.
3x(y+z)/radicalbig
9x(y+z)2 3/radicalbig
Rewrite 9as32
3x(y+z)/radicalbig
32x(y+z)2 3/radicalbig
Common index :6. Multiply ﬁrst group by 3,second by 2
33x3(y+z)334x2(y+z)4 6/radicalbig
Add exponents ,keep(y+z)as binomial
37x5(y+z)7 6/radicalbig

World View Note: Originally the radical was just a check mark with the rest of
the radical expression in parenthesis. In 1637 Rene Descart es was the ﬁrst to put
a line over the entire radical expression. 
The same process is used for dividing mixed index as with mult iplying mixed
index. The only diﬀerence is our ﬁnal answer cannot have a rad ical over the
denominator.

Radicals - Complex Numbers
Objective: Add, subtract, multiply, rationalize, and simp lify expres-
sions using complex numbers.
World View Note: When mathematics was ﬁrst used, the primary purpose was
for counting. Thus they did not originally use negatives, ze ro, fractions or irra-
tional numbers. However, the ancient Egyptians quickly dev eloped the need for “a
part” and so they made up a new type of number, the ratio or frac tion. The
Ancient Greeks did not believe in irrational numbers (peopl e were killed for
believing otherwise). The Mayans of Central America later m ade up the number
zero when they found use for it as a placeholder. Ancient Chin ese Mathematicians
made up negative numbers when they found use for them. 
In mathematics, when the current number system does not prov ide the tools to
solve the problems the culture is working with, we tend to mak e up new ways for
dealing with the problem that can solve the problem. Through out history this has
been the case with the need for a number that is nothing (0), sm aller than zero
(negatives), between integers (fractions), and between fr actions (irrational num-
bers). This is also the case for the square roots of negative n umbers. To work
with the square root of negative numbers mathematicians hav e deﬁned what are
called imaginary and complex numbers. 
Deﬁnition of Imaginary Numbers :i2=− 1 (thusi=− 1√)
Examples of imaginary numbers include 3i,− 6i,3
5iand3i5√
. Acomplex
number is one that contains both a real and imaginary part, such as 2+ 5i. 
With this deﬁnition, the square root of a negative number is n o longer undeﬁned. 
We now are allowed to do basic operations with the square root of negatives. 
First we will consider exponents on imaginary numbers. We wi ll do this by
manipulating our deﬁnition of i2=− 1 . If we multiply both sides of the deﬁnition
byi, the equation becomes i3=− i. Then if we multiply both sides of the equa-
tion again by i, the equation becomes i4=− i2=− (− 1) = 1 , or simply i4= 1 . 
Multiplying again by igivesi5=i. One more time gives i6=i2=− 1 . And if this
pattern continues we see a cycle forming, the exponents on ichange we cycle
through simpliﬁed answers of i,− 1 ,− i,1 . As there are 4 diﬀerent possible
answers in this cycle, if we divide the exponent by 4 and consi der the remainder, 
we can simplify any exponent on iby learning just the following four values: 
Cyclic Property of Powers of i
i0=1 
i=i
i2=− 1 
i3=− i
318Example 426.
i35Divide exponent by 4
8R3Use remainder as exponent on i
i3Simplify
− iOur Solution
Example 427.
i124Divide exponent by 4
31 R0Use remainder as exponent on i
i0Simplify
1 Our Solution
When performing operations (add, subtract, multilpy, divi de) we can handle ijust
like we handle any other variable. This means when adding and subtracting com-
plex numbers we simply add or combine like terms. 
Example 428.
(2 +5i) +(4 − 7i)Combine like terms 2+ 4 and5i− 7i
6− 2iOur Solution
It is important to notice what operation we are doing. Studen ts often see the
parenthesis and think that means FOIL. We only use FOIL to mul tiply. This
problem is an addition problem so we simply add the terms, or c ombine like
terms. 
For subtraction problems the idea is the same, we need to reme mber to ﬁrst dis-
tribute the negative onto all the terms in the parentheses. 
Example 429.
(4− 8i)− (3− 5i)Distribute the negative
4− 8i− 3+5iCombine like terms 4− 3and− 8i+ 5i
1 − 3iOur Solution
Addition and subtraction can be combined into one problem. 
Example 430.
(5i)− (3+ 8i)+ (− 4 +7i)Distribute the negative
5i− 3− 8i− 4 +7iCombine like terms 5i− 8i+ 7iand− 3− 4
− 7 +4iOur Solution
Multiplying with complex numbers is the same as multiplying with variables with
one exception, we will want to simplify our ﬁnal answer so the re are no exponents
oni.

(3i)(7i)Multilpy coeﬃcients and i′s

36i2− 54i3Simplify i2=− 1 andi3=− i
36(− 1)− 54(− i)Multiply
− 36+54iOur Solution
Remember when squaring a binomial we either have to FOIL or us e our shortcut
to square the ﬁrst, twice the product and square the last. The next example uses
the shortcut
Example 435.
(4− 5i)2Use perfect square shortcut
42=16 Square the ﬁrst
2(4)(− 5i)=− 40iTwice the product
(5i)2=25i2=25(− 1)=− 25 Square the last ,simplify i2=− 1 
16− 40i− 25 Combine like terms
− 9− 40iOur Solution
320Dividing with complex numbers also has one thing we need to be careful of. If iis
− 1 √
, and it is in the denominator of a fraction, then we have a radi cal in the
denominator! This means we will want to rationalize our deno minator so there
are no i’s. This is done the same way we rationalized denominators wi th square
roots.

321 Using iwe can simplify radicals with negatives under the root. We wi ll use the
product rule and simplify the negative as a factor of negativ e one. This is shown
in the following examples.

When simplifying complex radicals it is important that we ta ke the − 1 out of the

Quadratics - Solving with Radicals
Objective: Solve equations with radicals and check for extr aneous solu-
tions.
Here we look at equations that have roots in the problem. As yo u might expect, 
to clear a root we can raise both sides to an exponent. So to cle ar a square root
we can rise both sides to the second power. To clear a cubed roo t we can raise
both sides to a third power. There is one catch to solving a pro blem with roots in
it, sometimes we end up with solutions that do not actually wo rk in the equation. 
This will only happen if the index on the root is even, and it wi ll not happen all
the time. So for these problems it will be required that we che ck our answer in
the original problem. If a value does not work it is called an e xtraneous solution
and not included in the ﬁnal solution. 
When solving a radical problem with an even index: check answ ers! 
Example 442.
7x+ 2√

( 7x+ 2√)2=42Square both sides ,simplify exponents

(x− 1 3√)3=(− 4)3Cube both sides ,simplify exponents
x− 1 =− 64 Solve
326+ 1 +1 Add1 to both sides
x=− 63 Our Solution
Example 444.
3x+64√=− 3Even index ! We will have to check answers
( 3x+64√) =(− 3)4Rise both sides to fourth power
3x+6 = 81 Solve
− 6− 6Subtract 6from both sides
3x=75 Divide both sides by 3

3 =− 3False,extraneous solution
No Solution Our Solution
If the radical is not alone on one side of the equation we will h ave to solve for the
radical before we raise it to an exponent
Example 445.
x+ 4x+1 √= 5 Even index ! We will have to check solutions
− x − xIsolate radical by subtracting xfrom both sides
4x+1 √= 5− xSquare both sides
( 4x+ 1 √)2=(5− x)2Evaluate exponents ,recal(a− b)2=a2− 2ab+b2

− 4x− 1 − 4x− 1 Subtract 4xand1 from both sides

0=(x− 12)(x− 2) Set each factor equal to zero
x− 12=0orx− 2= 0 Solve each equation

2+ 8 +1 √= 5 Add
2+ 9√

2 +3= 5 Add
5= 5 True! It works
x= 2 Our Solution
The above example illustrates that as we solve we could end up with an x2term
or a quadratic. In this case we remember to set the equation to zero and solve by
factoring. We will have to check both solutions if the index i n the problem was
even. Sometimes both values work, sometimes only one, and so metimes neither
works. 
World View Note: The babylonians were the ﬁrst known culture to solve
quadratics in radicals - as early as 2000 BC! 
If there is more than one square root in a problem we will clear the roots one at a
time. This means we must ﬁrst isolate one of them before we squ are both sides. 
Example 446.
3x− 8√− x√=0 Even index ! We will have to check answers
+x√+x√Isolate ﬁrst root by adding x√to both sides
3x− 8√=x√Square both sides
( 3x− 8√)2= (x√)2Evaluate exponents
3x− 8=xSolve
− 3x− 3xSubtract 3xfrom both sides
− 8=− 2xDivide both sides by − 2
− 2− 2

0=0 True! It works
x=4 Our Solution
When there is more than one square root in the problem, after i solating one root
and squaring both sides we may still have a root remaining in t he problem. In
this case we will again isolate the term with the second root a nd square both
sides. When isolating, we will isolate the term with the square root. This means
the square root can be multiplied by a number after isolating . 
Example 447.
2x+ 1 √− x√= 1 Even index ! We will have to check answers
+x√+x√Isolate ﬁrst root by adding x√to both sides
2x+1 √=x√+ 1 Square both sides

Quadratics - Solving with Exponents
Objective: Solve equations with exponents using the odd roo t property
and the even root property.
Another type of equation we can solve is one with exponents. A s you might
expect we can clear exponents by using roots. This is done wit h very few unex-
pected results when the exponent is odd. We solve these probl ems very straight
forward using the odd root property
Odd Root Property :ifan=b,thena=bn√
when nis odd
Example 449.
x5=32 Use odd root property
x55√
=325√
Simplify roots
x=2 Our Solution
However, when the exponent is even we will have two results fr om taking an even
root of both sides. One will be positive and one will be negati ve. This is because
both32= 9and(− 3)2= 9. so when solving x2= 9we will have two solutions, one
positive and one negative: x= 3and− 3
Even Root Property :ifan=b,thena=±bn√
when nis even
Example 450.
x4=16 Use even root property (±)
332x44√
=±164√
Simplify roots
x=±2Our Solution
World View Note: In 1545, French Mathematicain Gerolamo Cardano pub-
lished his book The Great Art, or the Rules of Algebra which included the solu-
tion of an equation with a fourth power, but it was considered absurd by many to
take a quantity to the fourth power because there are only thr ee dimensions! 
Example 451.
(2x+ 4)2=36 Use even root property (±)
(2x+4)2/radicalbig
=±36√
Simplify roots
2x+ 4= ±6To avoid sign errors we need two equations
2x+ 4= 6 or2x+ 4= − 6One equation for +,one equation for − 
− 4− 4 − 4− 4Subtract 4from both sides
2x=2or2x=− 10 Divide both sides by 2
22 2 2
x=1 orx=− 5Our Solutions
In the previous example we needed two equations to simplify b ecause when we
took the root, our solutions were two rational numbers, 6and− 6. If the roots did
not simplify to rational numbers we can keep the ±in the equation. 
Example 452.
(6x− 9)2=45 Use even root property (±)
(6x− 9)2/radicalbig
=±45√
Simplify roots
6x− 9=±3 5√
Use one equation because root did not simplify to rational
+ 9 + 9 Add9to both sides
6x= 9±3 5√
Divide both sides by 6
6 6
x=9±3 5√
6Simplify ,divide each term by 3
x=3±5√
2Our Solution
333When solving with exponents, it is important to ﬁrst isolate the part with the
exponent before taking any roots. 
Example 453.
(x+4)3− 6=119 Isolate part with exponent
+ 6 +6
(x+4)3=125 Use odd root property
(x+4)3 3/radicalbig
=125√
Simplify roots
x+ 4=5 Solve
− 4− 4Subtract 4from both sides
x=1 Our Solution
Example 454.
(6x+1)2+6 = 10 Isolate part with exponent
− 6− 6Subtract 6from both sides
(6x+ 1)2=4 Use even root property (±)
(6x+1)2/radicalbig
=±4√
Simplify roots
6x+1 = ±2To avoid sign errors ,we need two equations
6x+1 =2 or6x+1 = − 2Solve each equation
− 1 − 1 − 1 − 1 Subtract 1 from both sides
6x= 1 or6x=− 3Divide both sides by 6
66 6 6
x=1 
6orx=− 1 
2Our Solution
When our exponents are a fraction we will need to ﬁrst convert the fractional
exponent into a radical expression to solve. Recall that am
n= (an√)m. Once we
have done this we can clear the exponent using either the even ( ±) or odd root
property. Then we can clear the radical by raising both sides to an exponent
(remember to check answers if the index is even). 
Example 455.
(4x+1)2
5= 9 Rewrite as aradical expression
( 4x+ 1 5√)2= 9 Clear exponent ﬁrst with even root property (±)

( 4x+ 1 5√)5= (±3)5Simplify exponents
4x+1= ±243 Solve ,need2equations ! 
4x+1= 243 or 4x+1= − 243
− 1 − 1 − 1 − 1 Subtract 1 from both sides
4x=242 or 4x=− 244 Divide both sides by 4
44 4 4
x=121 
2,− 61 Our Solution
Example 456.
(3x− 2)3
4=64 Rewrite as radical expression
( 3x− 24√)3=64 Clear exponent ﬁrst with odd root property
( 3x− 24√)3 3/radicalBig
=643√
Simplify roots
3x− 24√= 4 Even Index ! Check answers . 
( 3x− 24√)4=44Raise both sides to 4th power
3x− 2=256 Solve
+ 2 + 2 Add2to both sides
3x=258 Divide both sides by 3

x=86 Need to check answer in radical form of problem

)3=64 Multiply
(258− 24√)3=64 Subtract
(2564√
)3=64 Evaluate root
43=64 Evaluate exponent
64=64 True ! It works
x=86 Our Solution
With rational exponents it is very helpful to convert to radi cal form to be able to
see if we need a ±because we used the even root property, or to see if we need
to check our answer because there was an even root in the probl em. When
checking we will usually want to check in the radical form as i t will be easier to
evaluate.

Quadratics - Complete the Square
Objective: Solve quadratic equations by completing the squ are.
When solving quadratic equations in the past we have used fac toring to solve for
our variable. This is exactly what is done in the next example . 
Example 457.
x2+ 5x+6= 0 Factor
(x+ 3)(x+2)= 0 Set each factor equal to zero
x+ 3=0 orx+2= 0 Solve each equation
− 3− 3 − 2− 2
x=− 3 orx=− 2Our Solutions
However, the problem with factoring is all equations cannot be factored. Consider
the following equation: x2− 2x− 7 = 0 . The equation cannot be factored, however
there are two solutions to this equation, 1 + 2 2√
and1 − 2 2√
. To ﬁnd these two
solutions we will use a method known as completing the square . When completing
the square we will change the quadratic into a perfect square which can easily be
solved with the square root property. The next example revie ws the square root
property. 
Example 458.
(x+5)2=18 Square root of both sides
(x+ 5)2/radicalbig
=±18√
Simplify each radical
x+5 = ±3 2√
Subtract 5from both sides
− 5− 5
x=− 5±3 2√
Our Solution
337To complete the square, or make our problem into the form of th e previous
example, we will be searching for the third term in a trinomia l. If a quadratic is
of the form x2+bx+c, and a perfect square, the third term, c, can be easily
found by the formula/parenleftBig

2· b/parenrightBig2
. This is shown in the following examples, where we
ﬁnd the number that completes the square and then factor the p erfect square.

to use a method similar to completing the square, but their me thod was only used
to calculate positive roots. 
The advantage of this method is it can be used to solve any quad ratic equation. 
The following examples show how completing the square can gi ve us rational solu-
tions, irrational solutions, and even complex solutions.

World View Note: Indian mathematician Brahmagupta gave the ﬁrst explicit
formula for solving quadratics in 628. However, at that time mathematics was not
done with variables and symbols, so the formula he gave was, “ To the absolute
number multiplied by four times the square, add the square of the middle term; 
the square root of the same, less the middle term, being divid ed by twice the
square is the value.” This would translate to
4ac+b2/radicalbig

2aas the solution to the equation ax2+bx=c. 
We can use the quadratic formula to solve any quadratic, this is shown in the fol-
lowing examples.

Quadratics - Build Quadratics From Roots
Objective: Find a quadratic equation that has given roots us ing reverse
factoring and reverse completing the square.
Up to this point we have found the solutions to quadratics by a method such as
factoring or completing the square. Here we will take our sol utions and work
backwards to ﬁnd what quadratic goes with the solutions. 
We will start with rational solutions. If we have rational so lutions we can use fac-
toring in reverse, we will set each solution equal to xand then make the equation
equal to zero by adding or subtracting. Once we have done this our expressions
will become the factors of the quadratic. 
Example 471.
The solutions are 4and− 2Set each solution equal to x
x=4orx=− 2Make each equation equal zero
− 4− 4+2 + 2 Subtract 4from ﬁrst ,add2to second
x− 4= 0 orx+ 2= 0 These expressions are the factors
(x− 4)(x+ 2)= 0 FOIL
x2+2x− 4x− 8Combine like terms
x2− 2x− 8= 0 Our Solution
If one or both of the solutions are fractions we will clear the fractions by multi-
plying by the denominators. 
Example 472.
The solution are2

4Set each solution equal to x
x=2

4Clear fractions by multiplying by denominators
3x=2or4x=3 Make each equation equal zero
− 2− 2− 3− 3Subtract 2from the ﬁrst ,subtract 3from the second
3x− 2= 0 or4x− 3=0 These expressions are the factors
(3x− 2)(4x− 3) =0 FOIL
12x2− 9x− 8x+ 6=0 Combine like terms
34812x2− 17x+ 6=0 Our Solution
If the solutions have radicals (or complex numbers) then we c annot use reverse
factoring. In these cases we will use reverse completing the square. When there
are radicals the solutions will always come in pairs, one wit h a plus, one with a
minus, that can be combined into “one” solution using ±. We will then set this
solution equal to xand square both sides. This will clear the radical from our
problem. 
Example 473.
The solutions are 3√
and− 3√
Write as′′one′′expression equal to x
x=±3√
Square both sides
x2=3 Make equal to zero
− 3− 3Subtract 3from both sides
x2− 3=0 Our Solution
We may have to isolate the term with the square root (with plus or minus) by
adding or subtracting. With these problems, remember to squ are a binomial we
use the formula (a+b)2=a2+ 2ab+b2
Example 474.
The solutions are 2− 5 2√
and2+ 5 2√
Write as′′one′′expression equal to x
x=2±5 2√
Isolate the square root term
− 2− 2 Subtract 2from both sides
x− 2=±5 2√
Square both sides
x2− 4x+ 4= 25· 2
x2− 4x+4 = 50 Make equal to zero
− 50− 50 Subtract 50
x2− 4x− 46= 0 Our Solution
World View Note: Before the quadratic formula, before completing the square , 
before factoring, quadratics were solved geometrically by the Greeks as early as
300 BC! In 1079 Omar Khayyam, a Persian mathematician solved cubic equations
geometrically! 
If the solution is a fraction we will clear it just as before by multiplying by the
denominator.

The solutions are2 + 3√

Square both sides
16x2− 16x+ 4=3 Make equal to zero
− 3− 3Subtract 3
16x2− 16x+ 1=0 Our Solution
The process used for complex solutions is identical to the pr ocess used for radi-
cals. 
Example 476.
The solutions are 4− 5iand4+ 5iWrite as′′one′′expression equal to x

− 4− 4 Subtract 4from both sides
x− 4=±5iSquare both sides

x2− 8x+16=− 25 Make equal to zero
+25+25 Add 25 to both sides
x2− 8x+41 =0 Our Solution

Quadratics - Quadratic in Form
Objective: Solve equations that are quadratic in form by sub stitution
to create a quadratic equation.
We have seen three diﬀerent ways to solve quadratics: factor ing, completing the
square, and the quadratic formula. A quadratic is any equati on of the form 0 =
ax2+bx+c, however, we can use the skills learned to solve quadratics t o solve
problems with higher (or sometimes lower) powers if the equa tion is in what is
called quadratic form. 
Quadratic Form : 0 =axm+bxn+cwhere m= 2n
An equation is in quadratic form if one of the exponents on a va riable is double
the exponent on the same variable somewhere else in the equat ion. If this is the
case we can create a new variable, set it equal to the variable with smallest expo-
nent. When we substitute this into the equation we will have a quadratic equa-
tion we can solve. 
World View Note: Arab mathematicians around the year 1000 were the ﬁrst to
use this method! 
Example 478.

When we have higher powers of our variable, we could end up wit h many more
solutions. The previous equation had four unique solutions .

tions. We also can have irrational or complex solutions to ou r equations.

sion as shown in the next example.

Quadratics - Rectangles
Objective: Solve applications of quadratic equations usin g rectangles.
An application of solving quadratic equations comes from th e formula for the area
of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by mu ltiplying the width
by the length. To solve problems with rectangles we will ﬁrst draw a picture to
represent the problem and use the picture to set up our equati on. 
Example 484.
The length of a rectangle is 3 more than the width. If the area i s 40 square
inches, what are the dimensions?

From one rectangle we can ﬁnd two equations. Perimeter is fou nd by adding all
the sides of a polygon together. A rectangle has two widths an d two lengths, both
the same size. So we can use the equation P= 2l+ 2w(twice the length plus
twice the width).

Another type of rectangle problem is what we will call a “fram e problem”. The
idea behind a frame problem is that a rectangle, such as a phot ograph, is centered
inside another rectangle, such as a frame. In these cases it w ill be important to
rememember that the frame extends on all sides of the rectang le. This is shown in
the following example.

For each of the frame problems above we could have also comple ted the square or
use the quadratic formula to solve the trinomials. Remember that completing the
square or the quadratic formula always will work when solvin g, however, factoring
only works if we can factor the trinomial.

Quadratics - Teamwork
Objective: Solve teamwork problems by creating a rational e quation to
model the problem.
If it takes one person 4 hours to paint a room and another perso n 12 hours to
paint the same room, working together they could paint the ro om even quicker, it
turns out they would paint the room in 3 hours together. This c an be reasoned by
the following logic, if the ﬁrst person paints the room in 4 ho urs, she paints1
4of
the room each hour. If the second person takes 12 hours to pain t the room, he
paints1
12of the room each hour. So together, each hour they paint1
4+1
12of the
room. Using a common denominator of 12 gives: 3
12+1
12=4
12=1
3. This means
each hour, working together they complete1
3of the room. If1
3is completed each
hour, it follows that it will take 3 hours to complete the enti re room. 
This pattern is used to solve teamwork problems. If the ﬁrst p erson does a job in
A, a second person does a job in B, and together they can do a job in T (total). 
We can use the team work equation. 
Teamwork Equation :1
A+1
B=1

Often these problems will involve fractions. Rather than th inking of the ﬁrst frac-
tion as1
A, it may be better to think of it as the reciprocal of A’s time. 
World View Note: When the Egyptians, who were the ﬁrst to work with frac-
tions, wrote fractions, they were all unit fractions (numer ator of one). They only
used these type of fractions for about 2000 years! Some belie ve that this cumber-
some style of using fractions was used for so long out of tradi tion, others believe
the Egyptians had a way of thinking about and working with fra ctions that has
been completely lost in history.

Somtimes we only know how two people’s times are related to ea chother as in the
next example. 
Example 491.

plete the project in 10 hours. How long will it take each of the m to complete the

With problems such as these we will often end up with a quadrat ic to solve. 
Example 492.

30− 10=20 or 4− 10=− 6Find Britney ,can′thave negative time
Britney : 20 days ,Cosmo : 30 days Our Solution
In the previous example, when solving, one of the possible ti mes ended up nega-
tive. We can’t have a negative amount of time to build a shed, s o this possibility
is ignored for this problem. Also, as we were solving, we had t o factor x2− 34x+
120. This may have been diﬃcult to factor. We could have also c hosen to com-
plete the square or use the quadratic formula to ﬁnd our solut ions. 
It is important that units match as we solve problems. This me ans we may have
to convert minutes into hours to match the other units given i n the problem.

Quadratics - Simultaneous Products
Objective: Solve simultaneous product equations using sub stitution to
create a rational equation.
When solving a system of equations where the variables are mu ltiplied together
we can use the same idea of substitution that we used with line ar equations. 
When we do so we may end up with a quadratic equation to solve. W hen we used
substitution we solved for a variable and substitute this ex pression into the other
equation. If we have two products we will choose a variable to solve for ﬁrst and
divide both sides of the equations by that variable or the fac tor containing the
variable. This will create a situation where substitution c an easily be done.

We pick a variable to solve for, divide each side by that varia ble, or factor con-
taining the variable. This will allow us to use substitution to create a rational
expression we can use to solve. Quite often these problems wi ll have two solu-

Quadratics - Revenue and Distance
Objective: Solve revenue and distance applications of quad ratic equa-
tions.
A common application of quadratics comes from revenue and di stance problems. 
Both are set up almost identical to each other so they are both included together. 
Once they are set up, we will solve them in exactly the same way we solved the
simultaneous product equations. 
Revenue problems are problems where a person buys a certain n umber of items
for a certain price per item. If we multiply the number of item s by the price per
item we will get the total paid. To help us organize our inform ation we will use
the following table for revenue problems
Number Price Total
First
Second
The price column will be used for the individual prices, the t otal column is used
for the total paid, which is calculated by multiplying the nu mber by the price. 
Once we have the table ﬁlled out we will have our equations whi ch we can solve. 
This is shown in the following examples. 
Example 497.
A man buys several ﬁsh for S56. After three ﬁsh die, he decides to sell the rest at
a proﬁt of S5per ﬁsh. His total proﬁt was S4. How many ﬁsh did he buy to
begin with?

The above examples were solved by the quadratic formula and c ompleting the
square. For either of these we could have used either method o r even factoring. 
Remember we have several options for solving quadratics. Us e the one that seems
easiest for the problem. 
Distance problems work with the same ideas that the revenue p roblems work. 
The only diﬀerence is the variables are randt(for rate and time), instead of
nandp(for number and price). We already know that distance is calc ulated by
multiplying rate by time. So for our distance problems our ta ble becomes the fol-
lowing:

Jamaican Usain Bolt who set the record of running 100 m in 9.58 seconds on
August 16, 2009 in Berlin. That is a speed of over 23 miles per h our! 
Another type of simultaneous product distance problem is wh ere a boat is trav-
eling in a river with the current or against the current (or an airplane ﬂying with
the wind or against the wind). If a boat is traveling downstre am, the current will
push it or increase the rate by the speed of the current. If a bo at is traveling
376upstream, the current will pull against it or decrease the ra te by the speed of the
current. This is demonstrated in the following example. 
Example 500.
A man rows down stream for 30 miles then turns around and retur ns to his orig-
inal location, the total trip took 8 hours. If the current ﬂow s at 2 miles per hour,

Objective: Graph quadratic equations using the vertex, x-i ntercepts,
and y-intercept.
Just as we drew pictures of the solutions for lines or linear e quations, we can draw
a picture of solution to quadratics as well. One way we can do t hat is to make a

Plot the points (0,3),(1 ,0),(2,− 1),

Connect the dots with a smooth
curve. 
Our Solution
When we have x2in our equations, the graph will no longer be a straight line.
Quadratics have a graph that looks like a U shape that is calle d a parabola. 
World View Note: The ﬁrst major female mathematician was Hypatia of Egypt
who was born around 370 AD. She studied conic sections. The pa rabola is one
type of conic section. 
380The above method to graph a parabola works for any equation, h owever, it can be
very tedious to ﬁnd all the correct points to get the correct b end and shape. For
this reason we identify several key points on a graph and in th e equation to help
us graph parabolas more eﬃciently. These key points are desc ribed below. 
AB C
DPoint A: y-intercept: Where the graph
crosses the vertical y-axis. 
Points B and C: x-intercepts: Where
the graph crosses the horizontal x-axis
Point D: Vertex: The point where the
graph curves and changes directions. 
We will use the following method to ﬁnd each of the points on ou r parabola. 
To graph the equation y=ax2+bx+c,ﬁnd the following points
1. y-intercept: Found by making x= 0,this simpliﬁes down to y=c
2. x-intercepts: Found by making y= 0, this means solving 0=ax2+bx+c
3. Vertex: Let x=− b
2ato ﬁnd x. Then plug this value into the equation to ﬁnd
y. 
After ﬁnding these points we can connect the dots with a smoot h curve to ﬁnd
our graph! 
Example 502.
y=x2+4x+ 3 Find the key points

381 Graph the y-intercept at 3, the x-
intercepts at − 3and− 1 , and the
vertex at (− 2,− 1). Connect the dots
with a smooth curve in a U shape to
get our parabola. 
Our Solution
If the ainy=ax2+bx+cis a negative value, the parabola will end up being an
upside-down U. The process to graph it is identical, we just n eed to be very
careful of how our signs operate. Remember, if ais negative, then ax2will also be
negative because we only square the x, not the a.

Graph the y-intercept at − 9, the x-
intercepts at 3and1 , and the vertex at
(2,3). Connect the dots with smooth
curve in an upside-down U shape to
get our parabola. 
Our Solution
382It is important to remember the graph of all quadratics is a pa rabola with the
same U shape (they could be upside-down). If you plot your poi nts and we cannot
connect them in the correct U shape then one of your points mus t be wrong. Go
back and check your work to be sure they are correct! 
Just as all quadratics (equation with y=x2) all have the same U-shape to them
and all linear equations (equations such as y=x)have the same line shape when
graphed, diﬀerent equations have diﬀerent shapes to them. B elow are some
common equations (some we have yet to cover!) with their grap h shape drawn.

Functions - Function Notation
Objective: Idenﬁty functions and use correct notation to ev aluate func-
tions at numerical and variable values.
There are many diﬀerent types of equations that we can work wi th in algebra. An
equation gives the relationship between variables and numb ers. Examples of sev-
eral relationships are below: 
(x− 3)2
9− (y+2)2
4= 1 and y=x2− 2x+7 and y+x√− 7=xy
There is a speical classiﬁcation of relationships known as f unctions. Functions
have at most one output for any input. Generally xis the variable that we plug
into an equation and evaluate to ﬁnd y. For this reason xis considered an input
variable and yis considered an output variable. This means the deﬁnition o f a
function, in terms of equations in xandycould be said, for any xvalue there is at
most one yvalue that corresponds with it. 
A great way to visualize this deﬁnition is to look at the graph s of a few relation-
ships. Because xvalues are vertical lines we will draw a vertical line throug h the
graph. If the vertical line crosses the graph more than once, that means we have
too many possible yvalues. If the graph crosses the graph only once, then we say
the relationship is a function. 
386Example 504.
Which of the following graphs are graphs of functions?
Drawing a vertical line
through this graph will
only cross the graph
once, it is a function. Drawing a vertical line
through this graph will
cross the graph twice, 
once at top and once at
bottom. This is not a
function. Drawing a vertical line
through this graph will
cross the graph only
once, it is a function. 
We can look at the above idea in an algebraic method by taking a relationship
and solving it for y. If we have only one solution then it is a function. 
Example 505.
Is3x2− y=5a function ?Solve the relation for y
− 3x2− 3x2Subtract 3x2from both sides
− y=− 3x2+ 5 Divide each term by − 1 
− 1 − 1 − 1 
y= 3x2− 5 Only one solution for y. 
Yes! It isafunction
Example 506.
Isy2− x= 5a function ?Solve the relation for y
+x+x Addxto both sides
y2=x+ 5 Square root of both sdies
y2/radicalbig
=±x+ 5√
Simplify
y=±x+ 5√Two solutions for y(one+,one− )
No! Notafunction
Once we know we have a function, often we will change the notat ion used to
emphasis the fact that it is a function. Instead of writing y=, we will use func-
tion notation which can be written f(x) =. We read this notation “ fofx”. So for
387the above example that was a function, instead of writing y= 3x2− 5, we could
have written f(x) = 3x2− 5. It is important to point out that f(x)does not mean
ftimes x, it is mearly a notation that names the function with the ﬁrst letter
(function f) and then in parenthesis we are given information about what vari-
ables are in the function (variable x). The ﬁrst letter can be anything we want it
to be, often you will see g(x)(read gofx). 
World View Note: The concept of a function was ﬁrst introduced by Arab
mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi in the late 12th centur y
Once we know a relationship is a function, we may be intereste d in what values
can be put into the equations. The values that are put into an e quation (generally
thexvalues) are called the domain . When ﬁnding the domain, often it is easier
to consider what cannot happen in a given function, then excl ude those values. 
Example 507.
Find the domain : f(x) =3x− 1 
x2+x− 6With fractions ,zero can′tbe in denominator
x2+x− 6 /#020Solve by factoring
(x+ 3)(x− 2) /#020Set each factor not equal to zero
x+ 3 /#020andx− 2 /#020Solve each equation
− 3− 3 +2+ 2
x /#02− 3,2 Our Solution
The notation in the previous example tells us that xcan be any value except for
− 3and2. Ifxwere one of those two values, the function would be undeﬁned.
Example 508.
Find the domain : f(x)= 3x2− xWith this equation there are no bad values
All Real Numbers or R Our Solution
In the above example there are no real numbers that make the fu nction unde-
ﬁned. This means any number can be used for x. 
Example 509.
Find the domain : f(x) = 2 x− 3√
Square roots can′tbe negative
3882x− 3/greaterorequalslant0Set up an inequality
+ 3+ 3 Solve
2x/greaterorequalslant3
22
x/greaterorequalslant3
2Our Solution
The notation in the above example states that our variable ca n be3
2or any
number larger than3
2. But any number smaller would make the function unde-
ﬁned (without using imaginary numbers). 
Another use of function notation is to easily plug values int o functions. If we want
to substitute a variable for a value (or an expression) we sim ply replace the vari-
able with what we want to plug in. This is shown in the followin g examples. 
Example 510.
f(x) =3x2− 4x; ﬁndf(− 2) Substitute − 2in forxin the function
f(− 2)= 3( − 2)2− 4(− 2) Evaluate ,exponents ﬁrst
f(− 2)= 3(4) − 4(− 2) Multiply
f(− 2) =12+ 8 Add

As the above examples show, the function can take many diﬀere nt forms, but the
pattern to evaluate the function is always the same, replace the variable with
what is in parenthesis and simplify. We can also substitute e xpressions into func-
tions using the same process. Often the expressions use the s ame variable, it is
important to remember each variable is replaced by whatever is in parenthesis. 
Example 513.
g(x) =x4+1; ﬁndg(3x)Replace xin the function with (3x)
g(3x) =(3x)4+1 Simplify exponet

p(t+1) = t2+ 2t+ 1 − (t+1) Distribute negative
p(t+ 1)= t2+2t+1 − t− 1 Combine like terms
p(t+ 1)= t2+tOur Solution
It is important to become comfortable with function notatio n and how to use it as
we transition into more advanced algebra topics.

Functions - Operations on Functions
Objective: Combine functions using sum, diﬀerence, produc t, quotient
and composition of functions.
Several functions can work together in one larger function. There are 5 common
operations that can be performed on functions. The four basi c operations on func-
tions are adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. The notation for these
functions is as follows. 
Addition (f+g)(x) =f(x)+g(x)
Subtraction (f− g)(x)=f(x)− g(x)
Multiplication (f· g)(x)=f(x)g(x)
Division/parenleftbiggf
g/parenrightbigg
(x) =f(x)
g(x)
When we do one of these four basic operations we can simply eva luate the two
functions at the value and then do the operation with both sol utions
Example 515.
f(x) =x2− x− 2
g(x)=x+1 
ﬁnd(f+g)(− 3)Evaluate fandgat− 3
f(− 3) =( − 3)2− (− 3)− 2Evaluate fat− 3
f(− 3) =9 +3 − 2
f(− 3)=10
g(− 3) =( − 3)+1 Evaluate gat− 3
g(− 3) =− 2
f(− 3)+g(− 3) Add the two functions together
(10)+ (− 2) Add
8Our Solution
The process is the same regardless of the operation being per formed. 
Example 516.
h(x) =2x− 4
k(x) =− 3x+ 1 
Find(h· k)(5)Evaluate handkat5
h(5)= 2(5) − 4Evaluate hat5
393h(5) = 10− 4
h(5) =6
k(5) =− 3(5) +1 Evaluate kat5
k(5)=− 15+1 
k(5) =− 14
h(5)k(5) Multiply the two results together
(6)(− 14)Multiply
− 84 Our Solution
Often as we add, subtract, multiply, or divide functions, we do so in a way that
keeps the variable. If there is no number to plug into the equa tions we will simply
use each equation, in parenthesis, and simplify the express ion. 
Example 517.
f(x)= 2x− 4
g(x)=x2− x+ 5 Write subtraction problem of functions
Find(f− g)(x)
f(x)− g(x)Replace f(x)with(2x− 3)andg(x)with(x2− x+ 5)
(2x− 4)− (x2− x+ 5) Distribute the negative
2x− 4− x2+x− 5Combine like terms
− x2+ 3x− 9Our Solution
The parenthesis are very important when we are replacing f(x)andg(x)with a
variable. In the previous example we needed the parenthesis to know to distribute
the negative. 
Example 518.
f(x)=x2− 4x− 5
g(x)=x− 5
Find/parenleftbiggf
g/parenrightbigg
(x)Write division problem of functions
f(x)
g(x)Replace f(x)with(x2− 4x− 5)andg(x)with(x− 5)
(x2− 4x− 5)
(x− 5)To simplify the fraction we must ﬁrst factor
394(x− 5)(x+1)
(x− 5)Divide out common factor of x− 5
x+1 Our Solution
Just as we could substitute an expression into evaluating fu nctions, we can substi-
tute an expression into the operations on functions. 
Example 519.
f(x) =2x− 1 
g(x)=x+4 Write as asum of functions
Find(f+g)(x2)
f(x2)+g(x2)Replace xinf(x)andg(x)withx2
[2(x2)− 1]+ [( x2)+ 4] Distribute the +does not change the problem
2x2− 1+x2+4 Combine like terms
3x2+3 Our Solution
Example 520.
f(x)= 2x− 1 
g(x)=x+ 4 Write as aproduct of functions
Find(f· g)(3x)
f(3x)g(3x)Replace xinf(x)andg(x)with3x
[2(3x)− 1][(3x)+ 4] Multiply our 2(3x)
(6x− 1)(3x+ 4) FOIL
18x2+24x− 3x− 4Combine like terms
18x2+21 x− 4Our Solution
The ﬁfth operation of functions is called composition of fun ctions. A composition
of functions is a function inside of a function. The notation used for composition
of functions is: 
(f◦g)(x)=f(g(x))
To calculate a composition of function we will evaluate the i nner function and
substitute the answer into the outer function. This is shown in the following
example. 
395Example 521.
a(x) =x2− 2x+ 1 
b(x)=x− 5Rewrite as afunction in function
Find(a◦b)(3)
a(b(3)) Evaluate the inner function ﬁrst ,b(3)
b(3)=(3) − 5=− 2This solution is put into a, a(− 2)
a(− 2) =( − 2)2− 2(− 2)+ 1 Evaluate
a(− 2)=4 +4+ 1 Add
a(− 2)= 9 Our Solution
396We can also evaluate a composition of functions at a variable . In these problems
we will take the inside function and substitute into the outs ide function. 
Example 522.
f(x)=x2− x
g(x) =x+3
Find(f◦g)(x)Rewrite as afunction in function
f(g(x)) Replace g(x)withx+3
f(x+3) Replace the variables in fwith(x+ 3)
(x+ 3)2− (x+3) Evaluate exponent
(x2+ 6x+9)− (x+3) Distribute negative
x2+6x+ 9− x− 3Combine like terms
x2+ 5x+6 Our Solution
It is important to note that very rarely is (f◦g)(x)the same as (g◦f)(x)as the
following example will show, using the same equations, but c ompositing them in
the opposite direction. 
Example 523.
f(x)=x2− x
g(x) =x+ 3
Find(g◦f)(x)Rewrite as afunction in function
g(f(x)) Replace f(x)withx2− x
g(x2− x)Replace the variable in gwith(x2− x)
(x2− x) +3 Here the parenthesis don′tchange the expression
x2− x+3 Our Solution
World View Note: The term “function” came from Gottfried Wihelm Leibniz, a
German mathematician from the late 17th century.

Functions - Inverse Functions
Objective: Identify and ﬁnd inverse functions.
When a value goes into a function it is called the input. The re sult that we get
when we evaluate the function is called the output. When work ing with functions
sometimes we will know the output and be interested in what in put gave us the
output. To ﬁnd this we use an inverse function. As the name sug gests an inverse
function undoes whatever the function did. If a function is n amed f(x), the
inverse function will be named f− 1(x)(read “ finverse of x”). The negative one is
not an exponent, but mearly a symbol to let us know that this fu nction is the
inverse of f. 
World View Note: The notation used for functions was ﬁrst introduced by the
great Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler in the 18th centu ry. 
For example, if f(x) =x+ 5, we could deduce that the inverse function would be
f− 1(x) =x− 5. If we had an input of 3, we could calculate f(3) = (3) + 5 = 8 . Our
output is 8. If we plug this output into the inverse function w e getf− 1(8) = (8) − 
5= 3 , which is the original input. 
Often the functions are much more involved than those descri bed above. It may
be diﬃcult to determine just by looking at the functions if th ey are inverses. In
order to test if two functions, f(x)andg(x)are inverses we will calculate the
composition of the two functions at x. Iffchanges the variable xin some way, 
thengundoes whatever fdid, then we will be back at xagain for our ﬁnal solu-
tion. In otherwords, if we simplify (f◦g)(x)the solution will be x. If it is any-
thing but xthe functions are not inverses.

While the composition is useful to show two functions are inv erses, a more
common problem is to ﬁnd the inverse of a function. If we think ofxas our input
andyas our output from a function, then the inverse will take yas an input and
givexas the output. This means if we switch xandyin our function we will ﬁnd
the inverse! This process is called the switch and solve stra tegy. 
Switch and solve strategy to ﬁnd an inverse:
1. Replace f(x)withy
2. Switch xandy’s
3. Solve for y
4. Replace ywithf− 1(x)
Example 527.
Find the inverse of f(x) =(x+ 4)3− 2Replace f(x)withy
y=(x+ 4)3− 2Switch xandy
x= (y+ 4)3− 2Solve for y
+ 2 +2 Add2to both sides

x+ 23√=y+4 Subtract 4from both sides
− 4− 4
x+ 23√− 4=yReplace ywithf− 1(x)
f− 1(x)=x+23√− 4Our Solution

g− 1(x)=2x+3
2− 4xOur Solution
In this lesson we looked at two diﬀerent things, ﬁrst showing functions are
inverses by calculating the composition, and second ﬁnding an inverse when we
only have one function. Be careful not to get them backwards. When we already
have two functions and are asked to show they are inverses, we do not want to use
the switch and solve strategy, what we want to do is calculate the inverse. There
may be several ways to represent the same function so the swit ch and solve
strategy may not look the way we expect and can lead us to concl ude two func-
tions are not inverses when they are in fact inverses.

Functions - Exponential Functions
Objective: Solve exponential equations by ﬁnding a common b ase.
As our study of algebra gets more advanced we begin to study mo re involved
functions. One pair of inverse functions we will look at are e xponential functions
and logarithmic functions. Here we will look at exponential functions and then we
will consider logarithmic functions in another lesson. Exp onential functions are
functions where the variable is in the exponent such as f(x) =ax. (It is important
not to confuse exponential functions with polynomial funct ions where the variable
is in the base such as f(x)=x2). 
World View Note One common application of exponential functions is popula-
tion growth. According to the 2009 CIA World Factbook, the co untry with the
highest population growth rate is a tie between the United Ar ab Emirates (north
of Saudi Arabia) and Burundi (central Africa) at 3.69%. Ther e are 32 countries
with negative growth rates, the lowest being the Northern Ma riana Islands (north
of Australia) at − 7.08%. 
Solving exponetial equations cannot be done using the skill set we have seen in
the past. For example, if 3x= 9, we cannot take the x− root of 9 because we do
not know what the index is and this doesn’t get us any closer to ﬁnding x. How-
ever, we may notice that 9 is 32. We can then conclude that if 3x= 32thenx= 2. 
This is the process we will use to solve exponential function s. If we can re-write a
problem so the bases match, then the exponents must also matc h. 
Example 529.
52x+1=125 Rewrite 125 as 53
52x+1= 53Same base ,set exponents equal
2x+1= 3 Solve
− 1 − 1 Subtract 1 from both sides
2x= 2 Divide both sides by 2
22
x= 1 Our Solution
Sometimes we may have to do work on both sides of the equation t o get a
common base. As we do so, we will use various exponent propert ies to help. First
we will use the exponent property that states (ax)y=axy. 
406Example 530.
83x=32 Rewrite 8as23and 32 as 25
(23)3x= 25Multiply exponents 3and3x
29x= 25Same base ,set exponents equal
9x=5 Solve
99 Divide both sides by 9
x=5
9Our Solution
As we multiply exponents we may need to distribute if there ar e several terms
involved. 
Example 531.
273x+5=81 4x+1Rewrite 27 as 33and 81 as 34(92would not be same base )
(33)3x+5=(34)4x+1Multiply exponents 3(3x+5)and4(4x+1)
39x+15=316x+4Same base ,set exponents equal
9x+15=16x+4 Move variables to one side
− 9x − 9x Subtract 9xfrom both sides
15=7x+4 Subtract 4from both sides
− 4 − 4
11 = 7xDivide both sides by 7
77
11 
7=xOur Solution
Another useful exponent property is that negative exponent s will give us a recip-
rocal, 1
an=a− n
Example 532.
/parenleftbigg1 
9/parenrightbigg2x

9as3− 2(negative exponet to ﬂip )
(3− 2)2x= 37x− 1Multiply exponents − 2and2x
3− 4x= 37x− 1Same base ,set exponets equal
− 4x=7x− 1 Subtract 7xfrom both sides
− 7x− 7x
− 11 x=− 1 Divide by − 11 
− 11 − 11 
x=1 
11 Our Solution
If we have several factors with the same base on one side of the equation we can
add the exponents using the property that states axay=ax+y. 
407Example 533.
54x· 52x− 1= 53x+11 Add exponents on left ,combing like terms
56x− 1= 53x+11 Same base ,set exponents equal
6x− 1= 3x+11 Move variables to one sides
− 3x− 3x Subtract 3xfrom both sides
3x− 1=11 Add 1 to both sides
+1 + 1 
3x=12 Divide both sides by 3
33
x= 4 Our Solution
It may take a bit of practice to get use to knowing which base to use, but as we
practice we will get much quicker at knowing which base to use . As we do so, we
will use our exponent properties to help us simplify. Again, below are the proper-
ties we used to simplify. 
(ax)y=axyand1
an=a− nand axay=ax+y
We could see all three properties used in the same problem as w e get a common
base. This is shown in the next example.

All the problems we have solved here we were able to write with a common base. 
However, not all problems can be written with a common base, f or example, 2 =
10x, we cannot write this problem with a common base. To solve pro blems like
this we will need to use the inverse of an exponential functio n. The inverse is
called a logarithmic function, which we will discuss in anot her secion.

Functions - Logarithmic Functions
Objective: Convert between logarithms and exponents and us e that
relationship to solve basic logarithmic equations.
The inverse of an exponential function is a new function know n as a logarithm. 
Lograithms are studied in detail in advanced algebra, here w e will take an intro-
ductory look at how logarithms works. When working with radi cals we found that
there were two ways to write radicals. The expression anm√
could be written as
an
m. Each form has its advantages, thus we need to be comfortable using both the
radical form and the rational exponent form. Similarly an ex ponent can be
written in two forms, each with its own advantages. The ﬁrst f orm we are very
familiar with, bx=a, where bis the base, acan be thought of as our answer, and
xis the exponent. The second way to write this is with a logarit hm, log ba=x. 
The word “log” tells us that we are in this new form. The variab les all still mean
the same thing. bis still the base, acan still be thought of as our answer. 
Using this idea the problem 52=25 could also be written as log 525= 2. Both
mean the same thing, both are still the same exponent problem , but just as roots
can be written in radical form or rational exponent form, bot h our forms have
their own advantages. The most important thing to be comfort able doing with
logarithms and exponents is to be able to switch back and fort h between the two
forms. This is what is shown in the next few examples. 
Example 535.

Once we are comfortable switching between logarithmic and e xponential form we
are able to evaluate and solve logarithmic expressions and e quations. We will ﬁrst
evaluate logarithmic expressions. An easy way to evaluate a logarithm is to set
the logarithm equal to xand change it into an exponential equation. 
Example 537.
Evaluate log 264 Set logarithm equal to x

2x=64 Write as common base ,64= 26

World View Note: Dutch mathematician Adriaan Vlacq published a text in
1628 which listed logarithms calculated out from 1 to 100,00 0! 
411 Solve equations with logarithms is done in a very similar way , we simply will
change the equation into exponential form and try to solve th e resulting equation.

logx8= 3 Change to exponential form

There is one base on a logarithm that gets used more often than any other base, 
base 10. Similar to square roots not writting the common inde x of 2 in the rad-
ical, we don’t write the common base of 10 in the logarithm. So if we are working
on a problem with no base written we will always assume that ba se is base 10. 
Example 543.
logx=− 2Rewrite as exponent ,10 is base
10− 2=xEvaluate ,remember negative exponent is fraction

This lesson has introduced the idea of logarithms, changing between logs and
exponents, evaluating logarithms, and solving basic logar ithmic equations. In an
advanced algebra course logarithms will be studied in much g reater detail.

Functions - Compound Interest
Objective: Calculate ﬁnal account balances using the formu las for com-
pound and continuous interest.
An application of exponential functions is compound intere st. When money is
invested in an account (or given out on loan) a certain amount is added to the
balance. This money added to the balance is called interest. Once that interest is
added to the balance, it will earn more interest during the ne xt compounding
period. This idea of earning interest on interest is called c ompound interest. For
example, if you invest S100 at 10% interest compounded annually, after one year
you will earn S10 in interest, giving you a new balance of S110. The next year
you will earn another 10% or S11, giving you a new balance of S121. The third
year you will earn another 10% or S12.10, giving you a new balance of S133.10. 
This pattern will continue each year until you close the acco unt. 
There are several ways interest can be paid. The ﬁrst way, as d escribed above, is
compounded annually. In this model the interest is paid once per year. But
interest can be compounded more often. Some common compound s include com-
pounded semi-annually (twice per year), quarterly (four ti mes per year, such as
quarterly taxes), monthly (12 times per year, such as a savin gs account), weekly
(52 times per year), or even daily (365 times per year, such as some student
loans). When interest is compounded in any of these ways we ca n calculate the
balance after any amount of time using the following formula : 
Compound Interest Formula :A=P/parenleftBig
1 +r
n/parenrightBignt
A=Final Amount
P=Principle (starting balance )
r=Interest rate (asadecimal )
n=number of compounds per year
t=time(in years )
Example 544.
If you take a car loan for S25000 with an interest rate of 6.5% compounded quar-
terly, no payments required for the ﬁrst ﬁve years, what will your balance be at
the end of those ﬁve years?

It is interesting to compare equal investments that are made at several diﬀerent
types of compounds. The next few examples do just that. 
Example 546.
IfS4000 is invested in an account paying 3% interest compounded monthly, what
is the balance after 7 years?

415To investigate what happens to the balance if the compounds h appen more often, 
we will consider the same problem, this time with interest co mpounded daily. 
Example 547.
IfS4000 is invested in an account paying 3% interest compounded daily, what is
the balance after 7 years?

A=4934.67
S4934.67 Our Solution
While this diﬀerence is not very large, it is a bit higher. The table below shows
the result for the same problem with diﬀerent compounds. 
Compound Balance
Annually S4919.50
Semi-Annually S4927.02
Quarterly S4930.85
Monthly S4933.42
Weekly S4934.41 
Daily S4934.67
As the table illustrates, the more often interest is compoun ded, the higher the
ﬁnal balance will be. The reason is, because we are calculati ng compound interest
or interest on interest. So once interest is paid into the acc ount it will start
earning interest for the next compound and thus giving a high er ﬁnal balance. 
The next question one might consider is what is the maximum nu mber of com-
pounds possible? We actually have a way to calculate interes t compounded an
inﬁnite number of times a year. This is when the interest is co mpounded continu-
ously. When we see the word “continuously” we will know that w e cannot use the
ﬁrst formula. Instead we will use the following formula: 
Interest Compounded Continuously :A=Pert
A=Final Amount
P=Principle (starting balance )
e=aconstant approximately 2.71828183 /#09. 
r=Interest rate (written as adecimal )
t=time(years)
416The variable eis a constant similar in idea to pi ( π) in that it goes on forever
without repeat or pattern, but just as pi ( π) naturally occurs in several geometry
applications, so does eappear in many exponential applications, continuous
interest being one of them. If you have a scientiﬁc calculato r you probably have
anebutton (often using the 2nd or shift key, then hit ln) that wil l be useful in
calculating interest compounded continuously. 
World View Note: eﬁrst appeared in 1618 in Scottish mathematician’s
Napier’s work on logarithms. However it was Euler in Switzer land who used the
letter eﬁrst to represent this value. Some say he used ebecause his name begins
with E. Others, say it is because exponent starts with e. Others say it is because
Euler’s work already had the letter ain use, so e would be the next value. What-
ever the reason, ever since he used it in 1731, ebecame the natural base. 
Example 548.
IfS4000 is invested in an account paying 3% interest compounded continuously, 
what is the balance after 7 years?

Albert Einstein once said that the most powerful force in the universe is com-
pound interest. Consider the following example, illustrat ing how powerful com-
pound interest can be. 
Example 549.

Functions - Trigonometric Functions
Objective: Solve for a missing side of a right triangle using trigono-
metric ratios.
There are six special functions that describe the relations hip between the sides of
a right triangle and the angles of the triangle. We will discu ss three of the func-
tions here. The three functions are called the sine, cosine, and tangent (the three
others are cosecant, secant, and cotangent, but we will not n eed to use them
here). 
To the right is a picture of a right tri-
angle. Based on which angle we are
interested in on a given problem we
will name the three sides in relation-
ship to that angle. In the picture, 
angle A is the angle we will use to
name the other sides. The longest side, 
the side opposite the right angle is
always called the hypotenouse. The
side across from the angle A is called
the opposite side. AHypotenuse
AdjacentOpposite
The third side, the side between our angle and the right angle is called the adja-
cent side. It is important to remember that the opposite and a djacent sides are
named in relationship to the angle A or the angle we are using i n a problem. If
the angle had been the top angle, the opposite and adjacent si des would have
been switched. 
The three trigonometric funtions are functions taken of ang les. When an angle
goes into the function, the output is a ratio of two of the tria ngle sides. The
ratios are as describe below: 
sinθ=opposite
hypotenusecosθ=adjacent
hypotenusetanθ=opposite
adjacent
The “weird” variable θis a greek letter, pronounced “theta” and is close in idea to
our letter “t”. Often working with triangles, the angles are repesented with Greek
letters, in honor of the Ancient Greeks who developed much of Geometry. Some
students remember the three ratios by remembering the word “ SOH CAH TOA”
where each letter is the ﬁrst word of: “Sine: Opposite over Hy potenuse; Cosine: 
Adjacent over Hypotenuse; and Tangent: Opposite over Adjac ent.” Knowing how
to use each of these relationships is fundamental to solving problems using
trigonometry. 
World View Note: The word “sine” comes from a mistranslation of the Arab
word jayb
Example 550.
420Using the diagram at right, ﬁnd each
of the following: sin θ,cosθ,tanθ,sinα,
cosα,and tan α. 
First we will ﬁnd the three ratios of θ. 
The hypotenuse is 10, from θ, the
opposite side is 6 and the adjacent
side is 8. So we ﬁll in the following: 
sinθ=opposite
hypotenuse=6
10=3
5
cosθ=adjacent
hypotenuse=8
10=4
5
tanθ=opposite
adjacent=6
8=3
4
Now we will ﬁnd the three ratios of α. 
The hypotenuse is 10, from α, the
opposite side is 8 and the adjacent
side is 6. So we ﬁll in the following: 68
10α θ
108
αθ Opposite of θ
Adjacent of α6
HypotenuseAdjacent of θ
Opposite of α
sinα=opposite
hypotenuse=8
10=4
5
cosα=adjacent
hypotenuse=6
10=3
5
tanα=opposite
adjacent=8
6=4
3
We can either use a trigonometry table or a calculator to ﬁnd d ecimal values for
sine, cosine, or tangent of any angle. We only put angle value s into the trigono-
metric functions, never values for sides. Using either a tab le or a calculator, we
can solve the next example. 
Example 551.
sin 42◦Use calculator or table
0.669 Our Solution
tan 12◦Use calculator or table
0.213 Our Solution
cos 18◦Use calculator or table
0.951 Our Solution
By combining the ratios together with the decimal approxima tions the calculator
or table gives us, we can solve for missing sides of a triangle . The trick will be to
determine which angle we are working with, naming the sides w e are working
with, and deciding which trig function can be used with the si des we have. 
421 Example 552.
Find the measure of the missing side. 
x
425◦We will be using the angle marked
25◦, from this angle, the side marked 4
is the opposite side and the side
marked xis the adjacent side. 
The trig ratio that uses the opposite
and adjacent sides is tangent. So we
will take the tangent of our angle. 
tan25◦=4
xTangent is opposite over adjacent
0.466
1 =4
xEvaluate tan25◦,put over 1 so we have proportion
0.466x= 4 Find cross product
0.466 0.466 Divide both sides by 0.466
x=8.58 Our Solution
Example 553.
Find the measure of the missing side. 
x
9 70◦We will be using the angle marked
70◦. From this angle, the xis the
adjacent side and the 9 is the
hypotenuse. 
The trig ratio that uses adjacent and
hypotenuse is the cosine. So we will
take the cosine of our angle. 
cos70◦=x

Functions - Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Objective: Solve for missing angles of a right triangle usin g inverse
trigonometry.
We used a special function, one of the trig functions, to take an angle of a triangle
and ﬁnd the side length. Here we will do the opposite, take the side lengths and
ﬁnd the angle. Because this is the opposite operation, we wil l use the inverse
function of each of the trig ratios we saw before. The notatio n we will use for the
inverse trig functions will be similar to the inverse notati on we used with func-
tions.

Just as with inverse functions, the − 1 is not an exponent, it is a notation to tell
us that these are inverse functions. While the regular trig f unctions take angles as
inputs, these inverse functions will always take a ratio of s ides as inputs. We can
calculate inverse trig values using a table or a calculator ( usually pressing shift or
2nd ﬁrst). 
Example 554.
sinA=0.5 We don′tknow the angle so we use an inverse trig function
sin− 1(0.5)=A Evaluate using table or calculator
30◦=A Our Solution
cosB=0.667 We don′tknow the angle so we use an inverse trig function
cos− 1(0.667)=B Evaluate using table or calculator
48◦=B Our Solution
tanC=1.54 We don′tknow the angle so we use an inverse trig function
tan− 1(1.54)=CEvaluate using table or calculator
57◦=COur Solution
If we have two sides of a triangle, we can easily calculate the ir ratio as a decimal
and then use one of the inverse trig functions to ﬁnd a missing angle. 
Example 555.
Find the indicated angle. 
4281217θFrom angle θthe given sides are the
opposite (12) and the hypotenuse (17). 
The trig function that uses opposite
and hypotenuse is the sine
Because we are looking for an angle
we use the inverse sine
sin− 1/parenleftbigg12
17/parenrightbigg
Sine is opposite over hyptenuse ,use inverse to ﬁnd angle
sin− 1(0.706)Evaluate fraction ,take sine inverse using table or calculator
45◦Our Solution
Example 556.
Find the indicated angle
3 5
αFrom the angle α, the given sides are
the opposite (5) and the adjacent (3) 
The trig function that uses opposite
and adjacent is the tangent
As we are looking for an angle we will
use the inverse tangent. 
tan− 1/parenleftbigg5
3/parenrightbigg
Tangent is opposite over adjacent . Use inverse to ﬁnd angle
tan− 1(1.667)Evaluate fraction ,take tangent inverse on table or calculator
59◦Our Solution
Using a combination of trig functions and inverse trig funct ions, if we are given
two parts of a right triangle (two sides or a side and an angle) , we can ﬁnd all the
other sides and angles of the triangle. This is called solvin g a triangle. 
When we are solving a triangle, we can use trig ratios to solve for all the missing
parts of it, but there are some properties from geometry that may be helpful
along the way. 
The angles of a triangle always add up to 180◦, because we have a right triangle, 
90◦are used up in the right angle, that means there are another 90◦left in the
two acute angles. In other words, the smaller two angles will always add to 90, if
we know one angle, we can quickly ﬁnd the other by subtracting from 90. 
Another trick is on the sides of the angles. If we know two side s of the right tri-
angle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to ﬁnd the third sid e. The
Pythagorean Theorem states that if cis the hypotenuse of the triangle, and aand
429bare the other two sides (legs), then we can use the following f ormula, a2+b2=c2
to ﬁnd a missing side. 
Often when solving triangles we use trigonometry to ﬁnd one p art, then use the
angle sum and/or the Pythagorean Theorem to ﬁnd the other two parts. 
Example 557.
Solve the triangle
5
35◦We have one angle and one side. We
can use these to ﬁnd either other side. 
We will ﬁnd the other leg, the adja-
cent side to the 35◦angle. 
The 5 is the opposite side, so we will
use the tangent to ﬁnd the leg. 
tan35◦=5
xTangent is opposite over adjacent
0.700
1 =5
xEvaluate tangent ,put it over one so we have aproportion
0.700x= 5 Find cross product
0.700 0.700 Divide both sides by 0.700
x=7.1 The missing leg . 
a2+b2=c2We can now use pythagorean thorem to ﬁnd hypotenuse , c
52+7.1 2=c2Evaluate exponents
25+50.41 =c2Add
75.41 =c2Square root both sides
8.7=cThe hypotenuse
90◦− 35◦To ﬁnd the missing angle we subtract from 90◦
55◦The missing angle
35◦55◦

7.1 8.7
Our Solution
In the previous example, once we found the leg to be 7.1 we coul d have used the
sine function on the 35◦angle to get the hypotenuse and then any inverse trig
430function to ﬁnd the missing angle and we would have found the s ame answers. 
The angle sum and pythagorean theorem are just nice shortcut s to solve the
problem quicker. 
Example 558.
Solve the triangle
3
9In this triangle we have two sides. We
will ﬁrst ﬁnd the angle on the right
side, adjacent to 3 and opposite from
the 9. 
Tangent uses opposite and adjacent
To ﬁnd an angle we use the inverse
tangent.
