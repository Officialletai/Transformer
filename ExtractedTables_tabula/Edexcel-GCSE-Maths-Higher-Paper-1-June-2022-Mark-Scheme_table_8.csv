Question Answer,,Mark,Mark scheme,,,,,,,,,,Additional guidance
13 Relationship,,M1,"for use of Pythagoras’ theorem,",,,,,,,,,,May be seen at any stage
shown,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,eg d A 2 = d B 2+ d C 2 or a2 = b2 + c2 or (2x)2 = (2y)2 2 + (2 z )2,or a,=,,2 b,,+,c,,,"Where dA, a, 2x, etc are their diameters"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Could be any Pythagorean triple
,,,"or uses a 3, 4, 5 triangle",,,,,,,,,,

14 (a) 0.9,,M1,for drawing a tangent at t = 2,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,M1,for a complete method to find the gradient,,,,,,,,,,Use of change in y over change in x
,,,eg tangent at t = 2 and “2.7” ÷ “3”,,,,,,,,,,Working may be seen on the diagram
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A1,for answer in the range 0.7 to 1.1,,,,,,,,,,a
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Accept answers in the form  where a and b
,,,,,,,,,,,,,b
,,,,,,,,,,,,,are integers
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(b) Statement,,C1,eg distance (travelled),,,,,,,,,,If units are given they must be correct
