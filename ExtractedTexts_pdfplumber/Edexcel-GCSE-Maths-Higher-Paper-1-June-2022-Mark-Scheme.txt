© Pearson Education Ltd 2022General marking guidance
These notes offer general guidance, but the specific notes for examiners appertaining to individual questions take precedence.
1 All candidates must receive the same treatment. Examiners must mark the last candidate in exactly the same way as they mark the first.
Where some judgement is required, mark schemes will provide the principles by which marks will be awarded; exemplification/indicative
content will not be exhaustive. When examiners are in doubt regarding the application of the mark scheme to a candidate’s response,
the response should be sent to review.
2 All the marks on the mark scheme are designed to be awarded; mark schemes should be applied positively. Examiners should also be
prepared to award zero marks if the candidate’s response is not worthy of credit according to the mark scheme. If there is a wrong
answer (or no answer) indicated on the answer line always check the working in the body of the script (and on any diagrams), and award
any marks appropriate from the mark scheme.
Questions where working is not required: In general, the correct answer should be given full marks.
Questions that specifically require working: In general, candidates who do not show working on this type of question will get no
marks – full details will be given in the mark scheme for each individual question.
3 Crossed out work
This should be marked unless the candidate has replaced it with
an alternative response.
4 Choice of method
If there is a choice of methods shown, mark the method that leads to the answer given on the answer line.
If no answer appears on the answer line, mark both methods then award the lower number of marks.
5 Incorrect method
If it is clear from the working that the “correct” answer has been obtained from incorrect working, award 0 marks. Send the response to
review for your Team Leader to check.
6 Follow through marks
Follow through marks which involve a single stage calculation can be awarded without working as you can check the answer, but if
ambiguous do not award.
Follow through marks which involve more than one stage of calculation can only be awarded on sight of the relevant working, even if it
appears obvious that there is only one way you could get the answer given.7 Ignoring subsequent work
It is appropriate to ignore subsequent work when the additional work does not change the answer in a way that is inappropriate for the
question or its context. (eg an incorrectly cancelled fraction when the unsimplified fraction would gain full marks).
It is not appropriate to ignore subsequent work when the additional work essentially makes the answer incorrect (eg. incorrect algebraic
simplification).
8 Probability
Probability answers must be given as a fraction, percentage or decimal. If a candidate gives a decimal equivalent to a probability, this
should be written to at least 2 decimal places (unless tenths).
Incorrect notation should lose the accuracy marks, but be awarded any implied method marks.
If a probability fraction is given then cancelled incorrectly, ignore the incorrectly cancelled answer.
9 Linear equations
Unless indicated otherwise in the mark scheme, full marks can be gained if the solution alone is given on the answer line, or otherwise
unambiguously identified in working (without contradiction elsewhere). Where the correct solution only is shown substituted, but not
identified as the solution, the accuracy mark is lost but any method marks can be awarded (embedded answers).
10 Range of answers
Unless otherwise stated, when an answer is given as a range (eg 3.5 – 4.2) then this is inclusive of the end points (eg 3.5, 4.2) and all
numbers within the range
11 Number in brackets after a calculation
Where there is a number in brackets after a calculation eg 2 × 6 (=12) then the mark can be awarded either for the correct method,
implied by the calculation or for the correct answer to the calculation.
12 Use of inverted commas
Some numbers in the mark scheme will appear inside inverted commas eg “12” × 50 ; the number in inverted commas cannot be any
number – it must come from a correct method or process but the candidate may make an arithmetic error in their working.
13 Word in square brackets
Where a word is used in square brackets eg [area] × 1.5 : the value used for [area] does not have to come from a correct method or
process but is the value that the candidate believes is the area. If there are any constraints on the value that can be used, details will
be given in the mark scheme.
14 Misread
If a candidate misreads a number from the question. eg uses 252 instead of 255; method or process marks may be awarded provided
the question has not been simplified. Examiners should send any instance of a suspected misread to review.Guidance on the use of abbreviations within this mark scheme
M method mark awarded for a correct method or partial method
P process mark awarded for a correct process as part of a problem solving question
A accuracy mark (awarded after a correct method or process; if no method or process
is seen then full marks for the question are implied but see individual mark schemes
for more details)
C communication mark awarded for a fully correct statement(s)
with no contradiction or ambiguity
B unconditional accuracy mark (no method needed)
