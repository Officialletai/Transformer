Pre-Algebra - Integers
Objective: Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide Positive and Negative
Numbers.
The ability to work comfortably with negative numbers is essential to success in
algebra. For this reason we will do a quick review of adding, subtracting, multi-
plying and dividing of integers. Integers are all the positive whole numbers, zero,
and their opposites (negatives). As this is intended to be a review of integers, the
descriptions and examples will not be as detailed as a normal lesson.
World View Note: The first set of rules for working with negative numbers was
written out by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupa.
When adding integers we have two cases to consider. The first is if the signs
match, both positive or both negative. If the signs match we will add the num-
bers together and keep the sign. This is illustrated in the following examples
Example 1.
5+( 3) Samesign,add5+3,keepthenegative

Example 2.
7+( 5) Samesign,add7+5,keepthenegative

12 OurSolution

If the signs don’t match, one positive and one negative number, we will subtract
the numbers (as if they were all positive) and then use the sign from the larger
number. This means if the larger number is positive, the answer is positive. If the
larger number is negative, the answer is negative. This is shown in the following
examples.

For subtraction of negatives we will change the problem to an addition problem
which we can then solve using the above methods. The way we change a subtrac-
tion to an addition is to add the opposite of the number after the subtraction
sign. Often this method is refered to as “add the opposite.” This is illustrated in
the following examples.

8Multiplication and division of integers both work in a very similar pattern. The
short description of the process is we multiply and divide like normal, if the signs
match (both positive or both negative) the answer is positive. If the signs don’t
match (one positive and one negative) then the answer is negative. This is shown
in the following examples

A few things to be careful of when working with integers. First be sure not to
confuse a problem like 3 8 with 3( 8). The second problem is a multipli-
− − − −
cation problem because there is nothing between the 3 and the parenthesis. If
there is no operation written in between the parts, then we assume that means we
are multiplying. The 3 8 problem, is subtraction because the subtraction sep-
− −
arates the 3 from what comes after it. Another item to watch out for is to be
careful not to mix up the pattern for adding and subtracting integers with the
pattern for multiplying and dividing integers. They can look very similar, for
example if the signs match on addition, the we keep the negative, 3+( 7)=
− − −
10, but if the signs match on multiplication, the answer is positive, ( 3)( 7)=
− −

Pre-Algebra - Fractions
Objective: Reduce, add, subtract, multiply, and divide with fractions.
Working with fractions is a very important foundation to algebra. Here we will
briefly review reducing, multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions.
As this is a review, concepts will not be explained in detail as other lessons are.
World View Note: The earliest known use of fraction comes from the Middle
Kingdom of Egypt around 2000 BC!
We always like our final answers when working with fractions to be reduced.
Reducing fractions is simply done by dividing both the numerator and denomi-
nator by the same number. This is shown in the following example
Example 15.

The previous example could have been done in one step by dividing both numer-
ator and denominator by 12. We also could have divided by 2 twice and then
divided by 3 once (in any order). It is not important which method we use as
long as we continue reducing our fraction until it cannot be reduced any further.
The easiest operation with fractions is multiplication. We can multiply fractions
by multiplying straight across, multiplying numerators together and denominators
together.
Example 16.

When multiplying we can reduce our fractions before we multiply. We can either
reduce vertically with a single fraction, or diagonally with several fractions, as
long as we use one number from the numerator and one number from the denomi-
nator.

Dividing fractions is very similar to multiplying with one extra step. Dividing
fractions requires us to first take the reciprocal of the second fraction and mul-
tiply. Once we do this, the multiplication problem solves just as the previous
problem.

To add and subtract fractions we will first have to find the least common denomi-
nator (LCD). There are several ways to find an LCD. One way is to find the
smallest multiple of the largest denominator that you can also divide the small
denomiator by.

Adding and subtracting fractions is identical in process. If both fractions already
have a common denominator we just add or subtract the numerators and keep the
denominator.

While can be written as the mixed number 1 , in algebra we will almost never

use mixed numbers. For this reason we will always use the improper fraction, not
the mixed number.

If the denominators do not match we will first have to identify the LCD and build
up each fraction by multiplying the numerators and denominators by the same
number so the denominator is built up to the LCD.

Pre-Algebra - Order of Operations
Objective: Evaluate expressions using the order of operations, including
the use of absolute value.
When simplifying expressions it is important that we simplify them in the correct
order. Consider the following problem done two different ways:
Example 24.
2+5 3 Add First 2+5 3 Multiply
· ·
7 3 Multiply 2+15 Add
·
21 Solution 17 Solution
The previous example illustrates that if the same problem is done two different
ways we will arrive at two different solutions. However, only one method can be
correct. It turns out the second method, 17, is the correct method. The order of
operations ends with the most basic of operations, addition (or subtraction).
Before addition is completed we must do repeated addition or multiplication (or
division). Before multiplication is completed we must do repeated multiplication
or exponents. When we want to do something out of order and make it come first
we will put it in parenthesis (or grouping symbols). This list then is our order of
operations we will use to simplify expressions.
OrderofOperations:
Parenthesis (Grouping)
Exponents
Multiply and Divide (Left to Right)
Add and Subtract (Left to Right)
Multiply and Divide are on the same level because they are the same operation
(division is just multiplying by the reciprocal). This means they must be done left
to right, so some problems we will divide first, others we will multiply first. The
same is true for adding and subtracting (subtracting is just adding the opposite).
Often students use the word PEMDAS to remember the order of operations, as
the first letter of each operation creates the word PEMDAS. However, it is the
P
E
author’s suggestion to think about PEMDAS as a vertical word written as:
MD
AS
so we don’t forget that multiplication and division are done left to right (same
with addition and subtraction). Another way students remember the order of
operations is to think of a phrase such as “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally”
where each word starts with the same letters as the order of operations start with.
World View Note: The first use of grouping symbols are found in 1646 in the
Dutch mathematician, Franciscus van Schooten’s text, Vieta. He used a bar over
18the expression that is to be evaluated first. So problems like 2(3+5) were written
as 2 3+5.
·
Example 25.
2+3(9 4)2 Parenthesisfirst
−
2+3(5)2 Exponents
2+3(25) Multiply
2+75 Add
77 OurSolution
It is very important to remember to multiply and divide from from left to right!
Example 26.
30 3 2 Dividefirst(lefttoright!)
÷ ·
10 2 Multiply
·
20 OurSolution
In the previous example, if we had multiplied first, five would have been the
answer which is incorrect.
If there are several parenthesis in a problem we will start with the inner most
parenthesis and work our way out. Inside each parenthesis we simplify using the
order of operations as well. To make it easier to know which parenthesis goes with
which parenthesis, different types of parenthesis will be used such as { } and [ ]
and ( ), these parenthesis all mean the same thing, they are parenthesis and must
be evaluated first.
Example 27.
2 82 7[32 4(32+1)]( 1) Innermostparenthesis,exponentsfirst
{ − − ˜ − }
2 82 7[32 4(9+1)]( 1) Addinsidethoseparenthesis

16 OurSolution
As the above example illustrates, it can take several steps to complete a problem.
The key to successfully solve order of operations problems is to take the time to
show your work and do one step at a time. This will reduce the chance of making
a mistake along the way.
19There are several types of grouping symbols that can be used besides parenthesis.
One type is a fraction bar. If we have a fraction, the entire numerator and the
entire denominator must be evaluated before we reduce the fraction. In these
cases we can simplify in both the numerator and denominator at the same time.
Example 28.

20 OurSolution
Another type of grouping symbol that also has an operation with it, absolute
value. When we have absolute value we will evaluate everything inside the abso-
lute value, just as if it were a normal parenthesis. Then once the inside is com-
pleted we will take the absolute value, or distance from zero, to make the number
positive.

The above example also illustrates an important point about exponents. Expo-
nents only are considered to be on the number they are attached to. This means
when we see 42, only the 4 is squared, giving us (42) or 16. But when the
− − −
negative is in parentheses, such as ( 5)2 the negative is part of the number and
−
is also squared giving us a positive solution, 25.

Pre-Algebra - Properties of Algebra
Objective: Simplify algebraic expressions by substituting given values,
distributing, and combining like terms
In algebra we will often need to simplify an expression to make it easier to use.
There are three basic forms of simplifying which we will review here.
World View Note: The term “Algebra” comes from the Arabic word al-jabr
which means “reunion”. It was first used in Iraq in 830 AD by Mohammad ibn-
Musa al-Khwarizmi.
The first form of simplifying expressions is used when we know what number each
variable in the expression represents. If we know what they represent we can
replace each variable with the equivalent number and simplify what remains using
order of operations.
Example 30.
p(q+6)whenp=3andq=5 Replacepwith3andqwith5
(3)((5)+6) Evaluateparenthesis
(3)(11) Multiply
33 OurSolution
Whenever a variable is replaced with something, we will put the new number
inside a set of parenthesis. Notice the 3 and 5 in the previous example are in
parenthesis. This is to preserve operations that are sometimes lost in a simple
replacement. Sometimes the parenthesis won’t make a difference, but it is a good
habbit to always use them to prevent problems later.
Example 31.

22It will be more common in our study of algebra that we do not know the value of
the variables. In this case, we will have to simplify what we can and leave the
variables in our final solution. One way we can simplify expressions is to combine
like terms. Like terms are terms where the variables match exactly (exponents
included). Examples of like terms would be 3xy and 7xy or 3a2band8a2b or
− −
3and5. If we have like terms we are allowed to add (or subtract) the numbers in
front of the variables, then keep the variables the same. This is shown in the fol-
lowing examples
Example 32.
5x 2y 8x+7y Combineliketerms5x 8xand 2y+7y
− − − −
3x+5y OurSolution
−
Example 33.
8x2 3x+7 2x2+4x 3 Combineliketerms8x2 2x2and 3x+4xand7 3
− − − − − −
6x2+x+4 OurSolution
As we combine like terms we need to interpret subtraction signs as part of the fol-
lowing term. This means if we see a subtraction sign, we treat the following term
like a negative term, the sign always stays with the term.
A final method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with prob-
lems there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem difficult, if not
impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive
property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis
by each term inside of the parenthesis.
DistributiveProperty:a(b+c)=ab+ac
Several examples of using the distributive property are given below.
Example 34.
4(2x 7) Multiplyeachtermby4
−
8x 28 OurSolution
−
Example 35.
7(5x 6) Multiplyeachtermby 7
− − −
35+42 OurSolution
−
In the previous example we again use the fact that the sign goes with the number,
this means we treat the 6 as a negative number, this gives ( 7)( 6) = 42, a
− − −
positive number. The most common error in distributing is a sign error, be very
careful with your signs!
23It is possible to distribute just a negative through parenthesis. If we have a nega-
tive in front of parenthesis we can think of it like a 1 in front and distribute the
−
1 through. This is shown in the following example.
−
Example 36.
(4x 5y+6) Negativecanbethoughtofas 1
− − −
1(4x 5y+6) Multiplyeachtermby 1
− − −
4x+5y 6 OurSolution
− −
Distributing through parenthesis and combining like terms can be combined into
one problem. Order of operations tells us to multiply (distribute) first then add or
subtract last (combine like terms). Thus we do each problem in two steps, dis-
tribute then combine.
Example 37.
5+3(2x 4) Distribute3,multiplingeachterm

5+6x 12 Combineliketerms5 12

3x 2(4x 5) Distribute 2,multilpyingeachterm
− − −
3x 8x+10 Combineliketerms3x 8x
− −
5x+10 OurSolution
−
In the previous example we distributed 2, not just 2. This is because we will
−
always treat subtraction like a negative sign that goes with the number after it.
This makes a big difference when we multiply by the 5 inside the parenthesis,
−
we now have a positive answer. Following are more involved examples of dis-
tributing and combining like terms.

Solving Linear Equations - One Step Equations
Objective: Solve one step linear equations by balancing using inverse
operations
Solving linear equations is an important and fundamental skill in algebra. In
algebra, we are often presented with a problem where the answer is known, but
part of the problem is missing. The missing part of the problem is what we seek
to find. An example of such a problem is shown below.
Example 41.
4x+16= 4
−
Notice the above problem has a missing part, or unknown, that is marked by x. If
we are given that the solution to this equation is 5, it could be plugged into the
−
equation, replacing the x with 5. This is shown in Example 2.
−
Example 42.
4( 5)+16= 4 Multiply4( 5)
− − −
20+16= 4 Add 20+16
− − −
4= 4 True!
− −
Now the equation comes out to a true statement! Notice also that if another
number, for example, 3, was plugged in, we would not get a true statement as
seen in Example 3.
Example 43.
4(3)+16= 4 Multiply4(3)
−
12+16= 4 Add12+16
−
28 4 False!
− (cid:2)
Due to the fact that this is not a true statement, this demonstates that 3 is not
the solution. However, depending on the complexity of the problem, this “guess
and check” method is not very efficient. Thus, we take a more algebraic approach
to solving equations. Here we will focus on what are called “one-step equations” or
equations that only require one step to solve. While these equations often seem
very fundamental, it is important to master the pattern for solving these problems
so we can solve more complex problems.
28Addition Problems
To solve equations, the general rule is to do the opposite. For example, consider
the following example.
Example 44.
x+7= 5 The7isaddedtothex
−
7 7 Subtract7frombothsidestogetridofit
− −
x= 12 Oursolution!
−
Then we get our solution, x = 12. The same process is used in each of the fol-
−
lowing examples.

4 4 9 9 8 8
− − − − − −

− −
Table 1. Addition Examples
Subtraction Problems
In a subtraction problem, we get rid of negative numbers by adding them to both
sides of the equation. For example, consider the following example.
Example 46.
x 5=4 The5isnegative,orsubtractedfromx
−
+5 +5 Add5tobothsides
x=9 OurSolution!
Then we get our solution x=9. The same process is used in each of the following
examples. Notice that each time we are getting rid of a negative number by
adding.
29Example 47.
6+x= 2 10=x 7 5= 8+x
− − − − −
+6 +6 +7 +7 +8 +8
x=4 3=x 13=x
−
Table 2. Subtraction Examples
Multiplication Problems
With a multiplication problem, we get rid of the number by dividing on both
sides. For example consider the following example.
Example 48.
4x=20 Variableismultipliedby4
4 4 Dividebothsidesby4
x=5 Oursolution!
Then we get our solution x=5
With multiplication problems it is very important that care is taken with signs. If
x is multiplied by a negative then we will divide by a negative. This is shown in
example 9.
Example 49.
5x = 30 Variableismultipliedby 5
− −
5 5 Dividebothsidesby 5
− − −
x= 6 OurSolution!
−
The same process is used in each of the following examples. Notice how negative
and positive numbers are handled as each problem is solved.

Division Problems:
In division problems, we get rid of the denominator by multiplying on both sides.
For example consider our next example.

Table 4. Division Examples
The process described above is fundamental to solving equations. once this pro-
cess is mastered, the problems we will see have several more steps. These prob-
lems may seem more complex, but the process and patterns used will remain the
same.
World View Note: The study of algebra originally was called the “Cossic Art”
from the Latin, the study of “things” (which we now call variables).

Linear Equations - Two-Step Equations
Objective: Solve two-step equations by balancing and using inverse
opperations.
After mastering the technique for solving equations that are simple one-step equa-
tions, we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we solve two-step equa-
tions, the important thing to remember is that everything works backwards!
When working with one-step equations, we learned that in order to clear a “plus
five” in the equation, we would subtract five from both sides. We learned that to
clear “divided by seven” we multiply by seven on both sides. The same pattern
applies to the order of operations. When solving for our variable x, we use order
of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or subtract first, then
multiply or divide second (then exponents, and finally any parentheses or
grouping symbols, but that’s another lesson). So to solve the equation in the first
example,
Example 53.
4x 20= 8
− −
We have two numbers on the same side as the x. We need to move the 4 and the
20 to the other side. We know to move the four we need to divide, and to move
the twenty we will add twenty to both sides. If order of operations is done back-
wards, we will add or subtract first. Therefore we will add 20 to both sides first.
Once we are done with that, we will divide both sides by 4. The steps are shown
below.

ment.

− −
12 20= 8 Subtract12 20
− − −

33The same process is used to solve any two-step equations. Add or subtract first,
then multiply or divide. Consider our next example and notice how the same pro-
cess is applied.
Example 54.

7 7 Subtract7frombothsides
− −
5x = 0 Nowfocusonthemultiplicationby5
5 5 Dividebothsidesby5
x= 0 OurSolution!
Notice the seven subtracted out completely! Many students get stuck on this
point, do not forget that we have a number for “nothing left” and that number is
zero. With this in mind the process is almost identical to our first example.
A common error students make with two-step equations is with negative signs.
Remember the sign always stays with the number. Consider the following
example.
Example 55.

The same is true even if there is no coefficient in front of the variable. Consider

Solving two-step equations is a very important skill to master, as we study
algebra. The first step is to add or subtract, the second is to multiply or divide.
This pattern is seen in each of the following examples.

remain the same. In fact, as we solve problems like those in the next example,
each one of them will have several steps to solve, but the last two steps are a two-
step equation like we are solving here. This is why it is very important to master
two-step equations now!

Solving Linear Equations - General Equations
Objective: Solve general linear equations with variables on both sides.
Often as we are solving linear equations we will need to do some work to set them
up into a form we are familiar with solving. This section will focus on manipu-
lating an equation we are asked to solve in such a way that we can use our pat-
tern for solving two-step equations to ultimately arrive at the solution.
One such issue that needs to be addressed is parenthesis. Often the parenthesis
can get in the way of solving an otherwise easy problem. As you might expect we
can get rid of the unwanted parenthesis by using the distributive property. This is
shown in the following example. Notice the first step is distributing, then it is
solved like any other two-step equation.
Example 59.
4(2x 6)=16 Distribute4throughparenthesis
−
8x 24=16 Focusonthesubtractionfirst
−
+24+24 Add24tobothsides
8x=40 Nowfocusonthemultiplyby8
8 8 Dividebothsidesby8
x=5 OurSolution!
Often after we distribute there will be some like terms on one side of the equa-
tion. Example 2 shows distributing to clear the parenthesis and then combining
like terms next. Notice we only combine like terms on the same side of the equa-
tion. Once we have done this, our next example solves just like any other two-step
equation.
Example 60.
3(2x 4)+9=15 Distributethe3throughtheparenthesis

6x 3=15 Focusonthesubtractionfirst
−

6x=18 Nowfocusonmultiplyby6
376 6 Dividebothsidesby6
x=3 OurSolution
A second type of problem that becomes a two-step equation after a bit of work is
one where we see the variable on both sides. This is shown in the following
example.
Example 61.
4x 6=2x+10
−
Notice here the x is on both the left and right sides of the equation. This can
make it difficult to decide which side to work with. We fix this by moving one of
the terms with x to the other side, much like we moved a constant term. It
doesn’t matter which term gets moved, 4x or 2x, however, it would be the
author’s suggestion to move the smaller term (to avoid negative coefficients). For
this reason we begin this problem by clearing the positive 2x by subtracting 2x
from both sides.

2x 6=10 Focusonthesubtractionfirst
−

x=8 OurSolution!
The previous example shows the check on this solution. Here the solution is
plugged into the x on both the left and right sides before simplifying.
Example 62.
4(8) 6=2(8)+10 Multiply4(8)and2(8)first
−
32 6=16+10 AddandSubtract
−
26=26 True!
The next example illustrates the same process with negative coefficients. Notice
first the smaller term with the variable is moved to the other side, this time by
adding because the coefficient is negative.

Linear equations can become particularly intersting when the two processes are
combined. In the following problems we have parenthesis and the variable on both
sides. Notice in each of the following examples we distribute, then combine like
terms, then move the variable to one side of the equation.
Example 64.

Sometimes we may have to distribute more than once to clear several parenthesis.
Remember to combine like terms after you distribute!

x=6 OurSolution
This leads to a 5-step process to solve any linear equation. While all five steps
aren’t always needed, this can serve as a guide to solving equations.
1. Distribute through any parentheses.
2. Combine like terms on each side of the equation.
3. Get the variables on one side by adding or subtracting
4. Solve the remaining 2-step equation (add or subtract then multiply or
divide)
5. Check your answer by plugging it back in for x to find a true statement.
The order of these steps is very important.
World View Note: The Chinese developed a method for solving equations that
involved finding each digit one at a time about 2000 years ago!
We can see each of the above five steps worked through our next example.

1=1 True!
When we check our solution of x=2 we found a true statement, 1=1. Therefore,
we know our solution x=2 is the correct solution for the problem.
There are two special cases that can come up as we are solving these linear equa-
tions. The first is illustrated in the next two examples. Notice we start by dis-
tributing and moving the variables all to the same side.
Example 67.
3(2x 5)=6x 15 Distribute3throughparenthesis
− −
6x 15=6x 15 Noticethevariableonbothsides
− −
6x 6x Subtract6xfrombothsides
− −

− −
Here the variable subtracted out completely! We are left with a true statement,
15 = 15. If the variables subtract out completely and we are left with a true
− −
statement, this indicates that the equation is always true, no matter what x is.
Thus, for our solution we say all real numbers or R.
Example 68.
2(3x 5) 4x=2x+7 Distribute2throughparenthesis
− −
6x 10 4x=2x+7 Combineliketerms6x 4x

2x 10=2x+7 Noticethevariableisonbothsides

2x 2x Subtract2xfrombothsides
− −
10 7 Variableisgone!False!
− (cid:2)
Again, the variable subtracted out completely! However, this time we are left with
a false statement, this indicates that the equation is never true, no matter what x
is. Thus, for our solution we say no solution or ∅.

Solving Linear Equations - Fractions
Objective: Solve linear equations with rational coefficients by multi-
plying by the least common denominator to clear the fractions.
Often when solving linear equations we will need to work with an equation with
fraction coefficients. We can solve these problems as we have in the past. This is
demonstrated in our next example.
Example 69.
3 7 5
x = Focusonsubtraction
4 − 2 6
7 7 7

2 2 2

Notice we will need to get a common denominator to add + . Notice we have a
6 2
7 3 21
common denominator of 6. So we build up the denominator, = , and we
2 3 6
can now add the fractions:

We can get rid of by dividing both sides by . Dividing by a fraction is the

same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so we will multiply both sides by .

x= Multiplybyreciprocal

While this process does help us arrive at the correct solution, the fractions can
make the process quite difficult. This is why we have an alternate method for
dealing with fractions - clearing fractions. Clearing fractions is nice as it gets rid
of the fractions for the majority of the problem. We can easily clear the fractions
43by finding the LCD and multiplying each term by the LCD. This is shown in the
next example, the same problem as our first example, but this time we will solve
by clearing fractions.
Example 70.

The next example illustrates this as well. Notice the 2 isn’t a fraction in the ori-
gional equation, but to solve it we put the 2 over 1 to make it a fraction.
Example 71.

We can use this same process if there are parenthesis in the problem. We will first
distribute the coefficient in front of the parenthesis, then clear the fractions. This
is seen in the following example.

While the problem can take many different forms, the pattern to clear the frac-
tion is the same, after distributing through any parentheses we multiply each term
by the LCD and reduce. This will give us a problem with no fractions that is
much easier to solve. The following example again illustrates this process.

Solving Linear Equations - Formulas
Objective: Solve linear formulas for a given variable.
Solving formulas is much like solving general linear equations. The only difference
is we will have several varaibles in the problem and we will be attempting to solve
for one specific variable. For example, we may have a formula such as A = πr2 +
πrs (formula for surface area of a right circular cone) and we may be interested in
solving for the varaible s. This means we want to isolate the s so the equation has
s on one side, and everything else on the other. So a solution might look like s=
A πr2
− . This second equation gives the same information as the first, they are
πs
algebraically equivalent, however, one is solved for the area, while the other is
solved for s (slant height of the cone). In this section we will discuss how we can
move from the first equation to the second.
When solving formulas for a variable we need to focus on the one varaible we are
trying to solve for, all the others are treated just like numbers. This is shown in
the following example. Two parallel problems are shown, the first is a normal one-
step equation, the second is a formula that we are solving for x
Example 74.
3x=12 wx=z Inbothproblems,xismultipliedbysomething
3 3 w w Toisolatethexwedivideby3orw.
z
x=4 x= OurSolution
w
We use the same process to solve 3x = 12 for x as we use to solve wx = z for x.
Because we are solving for x we treat all the other variables the same way we
would treat numbers. Thus, to get rid of the multiplication we divided by w. This
same idea is seen in the following example.
Example 75.
m+n=p forn Solvingforn,treatallothervariableslikenumbers
m m Subtractmfrombothsides
− −
n=p m OurSolution
−
As p and m are not like terms, they cannot be combined. For this reason we leave
the expression as p m. This same one-step process can be used with grouping
−
symbols.

a= OurSolution
x y
−
Because (x y) is in parenthesis, if we are not searching for what is inside the
−
parenthesis, we can keep them together as a group and divide by that group.
However, if we are searching for what is inside the parenthesis, we will have to
break up the parenthesis by distributing. The following example is the same for-
mula, but this time we will solve for x.
Example 77.
a(x y)=b forx Solvingforx,weneedtodistributetoclearparenthesis

− −
+ay+ay Addaytobothsides
ax=b+ay Thexismultipiedbya
a a Dividebothsidesbya
b+ay
x= OurSolution
a
Be very careful as we isolate x that we do not try and cancel the a on top and
bottom of the fraction. This is not allowed if there is any adding or subtracting in
the fraction. There is no reducing possible in this problem, so our final reduced
b+ay
answer remains x= . The next example is another two-step problem

− =m OurSolution
x
It is important to note that we know we are done with the problem when the
variable we are solving for is isolated or alone on one side of the equation and it
does not appear anywhere on the other side of the equation.
The next example is also a two-step equation, it is the problem we started with at

πr
Again, we cannot reduce the πr in the numerator and denominator because of the
subtraction in the problem.
Formulas often have fractions in them and can be solved in much the same way
we solved with fractions before. First identify the LCD and then multiply each
term by the LCD. After we reduce there will be no more fractions in the problem
so we can solve like any general equation from there.

Depending on the context of the problem we may find a formula that uses the
same letter, one capital, one lowercase. These represent different values and we
must be careful not to combine a capital variable with a lower case variable.

Notice the A and a were not combined as like terms. This is because a formula
will often use a capital letter and lower case letter to represent different variables.
Often with formulas there is more than one way to solve for a variable. The next
example solves the same problem in a slightly different manner. After clearing the
denominator, we divide by a to move it to the other side, rather than distributing.

Both answers to the last two examples are correct, they are just written in a dif-
ferent form because we solved them in different ways. This is very common with
formulas, there may be more than one way to solve for a varaible, yet both are
equivalent and correct.
World View Note: The father of algebra, Persian mathematician Muhammad
ibn Musa Khwarizmi, introduced the fundamental idea of blancing by subtracting
the same term to the other side of the equation. He called this process al-jabr
which later became the world algebra.

Solving Linear Equations - Absolute Value
Objective: Solve linear absolute value equations.
When solving equations with absolute value we can end up with more than one
possible answer. This is because what is in the absolute value can be either nega-
tive or positive and we must account for both possibilities when solving equations.
This is illustrated in the following example.
Example 84.
x =7 Absolutevaluecanbepositiveornegative
| |
x=7 or x= 7 OurSolution
−
Notice that we have considered two possibilities, both the positive and negative.
Either way, the absolute value of our number will be positive 7.
World View Note: The first set of rules for working with negatives came from
7th century India. However, in 1758, almost a thousand years later, British math-
ematician Francis Maseres claimed that negatives “Darken the very whole doc-
trines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature
excessively obvious and simple.”
When we have absolute values in our problem it is important to first isolate the
absolute value, then remove the absolute value by considering both the positive
and negative solutions. Notice in the next two examples, all the numbers outside
of the absolute value are moved to the other side first before we remove the abso-
lute value bars and consider both positive and negative solutions.
Example 85.
5+ x =8 Noticeabsolutevalueisnotalone

− | | −
4 4 Dividebothsidesby 4
− − −
52x =5 Absolutevaluecanbepositiveornegative
| |
x=5 or x= 5 OurSolution
−
Notice we never combine what is inside the absolute value with what is outside
the absolute value. This is very important as it will often change the final result
to an incorrect solution. The next example requires two steps to isolate the abso-
lute value. The idea is the same as a two-step equation, add or subtract, then
multiply or divide.
Example 87.
5 x 4=26 Noticetheabsolutevalueisnotalone
| |−
+4 +4 Add4tobothsides
5 x =30 Absolutevaluestillnotalone
| |
5 5 Dividebothsidesby5
x =6 Absolutevaluecanbepositiveornegative
| |
x=6 or x= 6 OurSolution
−
Again we see the same process, get the absolute value alone first, then consider
the positive and negative solutions. Often the absolute value will have more than
just a variable in it. In this case we will have to solve the resulting equations
when we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is shown in the next
example.
Example 88.
2x 1 =7 Absolutevaluecanbepositiveornegative
| − |
2x 1=7 or 2x 1= 7 Twoequationstosolve
− − −
Now notice we have two equations to solve, each equation will give us a different
solution. Both equations solve like any other two-step equation.
2x 1=7 2x 1= 7
− − −
+1+1 +1 +1
2x=8 or 2x= 6
−
2 2 2 2
x=4 x= 3
−
53Thus, from our previous example we have two solutions, x=4 or x= 3.
−
Again, it is important to remember that the absolute value must be alone first
before we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is illustrated in
below.
Example 89.
2 4 2x+3 = 18
− | | −
To get the absolute value alone we first need to get rid of the 2 by subtracting,
then divide by 4. Notice we cannot combine the 2 and 4 becuase they are
− −
not like terms, the 4 has the absolute value connected to it. Also notice we do
−
not distribute the 4 into the absolute value. This is because the numbers out-
−
side cannot be combined with the numbers inside the absolute value. Thus we get
the absolute value alone in the following way:
2 4 2x+3 = 18 Noticeabsolutevalueisnotalone
− | | −
2 2 Subtract2frombothsides
− −
4 2x+3 = 20 Absolutevaluestillnotalone

4 4 Dividebothsidesby 4
− − −
2x+3 =5 Absoloutevaluecanbepositiveornegative
| |
2x+3=5 or 2x+3= 5 Twoequationstosolve
−
Now we just solve these two remaining equations to find our solutions.
2x+3=5 2x+3= 5
−
3 3 3 3
− − − −
2x=2 or 2x= 8
−
2 2 2 2
x=1 x= 4
−
We now have our two solutions, x=1 and x= 4.
−
As we are solving absolute value equations it is important to be aware of special
cases. Remember the result of an absolute value must always be positive. Notice
what happens in the next example.
54Example 90.
7+ 2x 5 =4 Noticeabsolutevalueisnotalone
| − |
7 7 Subtract7frombothsides
− −
2x 5 = 3 Resultofabsolutevalueisnegative!
| − | −
Notice the absolute value equals a negative number! This is impossible with abso-
lute value. When this occurs we say there is no solution or ∅.
One other type of absolute value problem is when two absolute values are equal to
eachother. We still will consider both the positive and negative result, the differ-
ence here will be that we will have to distribute a negative into the second abso-
lute value for the negative possibility.
Example 91.
2x 7 = 4x+6 Absolutevaluecanbepositiveornegative
| − | | |
2x 7=4x+6 or 2x 7= (4x+6) makesecondpartofsecondequationnegative
− − −
Notice the first equation is the positive possibility and has no significant differ-
ence other than the missing absolute value bars. The second equation considers
the negative possibility. For this reason we have a negative in front of the expres-
sion which will be distributed through the equation on the first step of solving. So
we solve both these equations as follows:
2x 7= (4x+6)
2x 7=4x+6 − −
− 2x 7= 4x 6

Solving Linear Equations - Variation
Objective: Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and
finding the variation constant.
One application of solving linear equations is variation. Often different events are
related by what is called the constant of variation. For example, the time it takes
to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are traveling. The faster you
travel, the less time it take to get there. This is one type of variation problem, we
will look at three types of variation here. Variation problems have two or three
variables and a constant in them. The constant, usually noted with a k, describes
the relationship and does not change as the other variables in the problem change.
There are two ways to set up a variation problem, the first solves for one of the
variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. Here we will use the
second method.
The greek letter pi (π) is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter.
World View Note: In the 5th centure, Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi cal-
culated the value of π to seven decimal places (3.1415926). This was the most
accurate value of π for the next 1000 years!
If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter
you will always get the same value, about 3.14159... If you have a bigger circum-
ference you will also have a bigger diameter. This relationship is called direct
variation or directly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we
know to divide to find the constant of variation.
Example 92.

n
In kickboxing, one will find that the longer the board, the easier it is to break. If
you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board you
will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variables, which means as
one variable increases, the other variable decreases. This relationship is called
indirect variation or inversly proportional. If we see this phrase in the
problem we know to multiply to find the constant of variation.
Example 93.

57The formula for the area of a triangle has three variables in it. If we divide the
1.
area by the base times the height we will also get a constant, This relationship
2
is called joint variation or jointly proportional. If we see this phrase in the
problem we know to divide the first variable by the product of the other two to
find the constant of variation.
Example 94.

Once we have our formula for the relationship in a variation problem, we use
given or known information to calculate the constant of variation. This is shown
for each type of variation in the next three examples.

58Once we have found the constant of variation we can use it to find other combina-
tions in the same relationship. Each of these problems we solve will have three
important steps, none of which should be skipped.
1. Find the formula for the relationship using the type of variation
2. Find the constant of variation using known values
3. Answer the question using the constant of variation
The next three examples show how this process is worked out for each type of
variation.

Sometimes a variation problem will ask us to do something to a variable as we set
up the formula for the relationship. For example, π can be thought of as the ratio
of the area and the radius squared. This is still direct variation, we say the area
varies directly as the radius square and thus our variable is squared in our for-
mula. This is shown in the next example.
Example 101.
The area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of the radius. A circle
with a radius of 10 has an area of 314. What will the area be on a circle of radius

the variation formula, find the constant, and solve the final equation.

35. The intensity of a light from a light bulb varies inversely as the square of the
distance from the bulb. Suppose intensity is 90 W/m2 (watts per square
meter) when the distance is 5 m. How much further would it be to a point
where the intesity is 40 W/m2?
36. The volume of a cone varies jointly as its height, and the square of its radius.
If a cone with a height of 8 centimeters and a radius of 2 centimeters has a
volume of 33.5 cm3, what is the volume of a cone with a height of 6 centime-
ters and a radius of 4 centimeters?
37. The intensity of a television signal varies inversely as the square of the dis-
tance from the transmitter. If the intensity is 25 W/m2 at a distance of 2 km,
how far from the trasmitter are you when the intensity is 2.56 W/m2?
38. The intensity of illumination falling on a surface from a given source of light
is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of light.
The unit for measuring the intesity of illumination is usually the footcandle. If
a given source of light gives an illumination of 1 foot-candle at a distance of
10 feet, what would the illumination be from the same source at a distance
of 20 feet?

Linear Equations - Number and Geometry
Objective: Solve number and geometry problems by creating and
solving a linear equation.
Word problems can be tricky. Often it takes a bit of practice to convert the
English sentence into a mathematical sentence. This is what we will focus on here
with some basic number problems, geometry problems, and parts problems.
A few important phrases are described below that can give us clues for how to set
up a problem.
A number (or unknown, a value, etc) often becomes our variable
•
Is (or other forms of is: was, will be, are, etc) often represents equals (=)
•
x is 5 becomes x=5
More than often represents addition and is usually built backwards,
•
writing the second part plus the first
Three more than a number becomes x+3
Less than often represents subtraction and is usually built backwards as
•
well, writing the second part minus the first
Four less than a number becomes x 4
−
Using these key phrases we can take a number problem and set up and equation
and solve.
Example 102.
If 28 less than five times a certain number is 232. What is the number?

This same idea can be extended to a more involved problem as shown in the next
example.

Another type of number problem involves consecutive numbers. Consecutive
numbers are numbers that come one after the other, such as 3, 4, 5. If we are
looking for several consecutive numbers it is important to first identify what they
look like with variables before we set up the equation. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example.
Example 104.
The sum of three consecutive integers is 93. What are the integers?

Secondx+1 Togetthenextnumberwegouponeor+1

Second(30)+1=31 Thenumbersare30,31,and32
Third(30)+2=32
Sometimes we will work consective even or odd integers, rather than just consecu-
tive integers. When we had consecutive integers, we only had to add 1 to get to
the next number so we had x, x + 1, and x + 2 for our first, second, and third
number respectively. With even or odd numbers they are spaced apart by two. So
if we want three consecutive even numbers, if the first is x, the next number
would be x + 2, then finally add two more to get the third, x + 4. The same is
65true for consecutive odd numbers, if the first is x, the next will be x+2, and the
third would be x+4. It is important to note that we are still adding 2 and 4 even
when the numbers are odd. This is because the phrase “odd” is refering to our x,
not to what is added to the numbers. Consider the next two examples.
Example 105.
The sum of three consecutive even integers is 246. What are the numbers?

66When we started with our first, second, and third numbers for both even and odd
we had x, x+2, and x+4. The numbers added do not change with odd or even,
it is our answer for x that will be odd or even.
Another example of translating English sentences to mathematical sentences
comes from geometry. A well known property of triangles is that all three angles
will always add to 180. For example, the first angle may be 50 degrees, the second
30 degrees, and the third 100 degrees. If you add these together, 50+30 +100=
180. We can use this property to find angles of triangles.
World View Note: German mathematician Bernhart Thibaut in 1809 tried to
prove that the angles of a triangle add to 180 without using Euclid’s parallel pos-
tulate (a point of much debate in math history). He created a proof, but it was
later shown to have an error in the proof.
Example 107.
The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is 40 less than
the first. Find the three angles.

Another geometry problem involves perimeter or the distance around an object.
For example, consider a rectangle has a length of 8 and a width of 3. There are
two lengths and two widths in a rectangle (opposite sides) so we add 8 + 8 + 3 +
3 = 22. As there are two lengths and two widths in a rectangle an alternative to
find the perimeter of a rectangle is to use the formula P = 2L + 2W. So for the
rectangle of length 8 and width 3 the formula would give, P =2(8) +2(3) =16+
6=22. With problems that we will consider here the formula P =2L+2W will be
used.
Example 108.
67The perimeter of a rectangle is 44. The length is 5 less than double the width.
Find the dimensions.

We have seen that it is imortant to start by clearly labeling the variables in a
short list before we begin to solve the problem. This is important in all word
problems involving variables, not just consective numbers or geometry problems.
This is shown in the following example.
Example 109.
A sofa and a love seat together costs S444. The sofa costs double the love seat.
How much do they each cost?
LoveSeatx Withnoinformationabouttheloveseat,thisisourx
Sofa2x Sofaisdoubletheloveseat,sowemultiplyby2

x=148 Oursolutionforx
LoveSeat148 Replacexwith148intheorigionallist
Sofa2(148)=296 TheloveseatcostsS148andthesofacostsS296.
Be careful on problems such as these. Many students see the phrase “double” and
believe that means we only have to divide the 444 by 2 and get S222 for one or
both of the prices. As you can see this will not work. By clearly labeling the vari-
ables in the original list we know exactly how to set up and solve these problems.

Solving Linear Equations - Age Problems
Objective: Solve age problems by creating and solving a linear equa-
tion.
An application of linear equations is what are called age problems. When we are
solving age problems we generally will be comparing the age of two people both
now and in the future (or past). Using the clues given in the problem we will be
working to find their current age. There can be a lot of information in these prob-
lems and we can easily get lost in all the information. To help us organize and
solve our problem we will fill out a three by three table for each problem. An
example of the basic structure of the table is below
Age Now Change
Person 1
Person 2
Table 6. Structure of Age Table
Normally where we see “Person 1” and “Person 2” we will use the name of the
person we are talking about. We will use this table to set up the following
example.
Example 110.
Adam is 20 years younger than Brian. In two years Brian will be twice as old as
Adam. How old are they now?

Solving age problems can be summarized in the following five steps. These five
steps are guidelines to help organize the problem we are trying to solve.
1. Fill in the now column. The person we know nothing about is x.
2. Fill in the future/past collumn by adding/subtracting the change to the
now column.
3. Make an equation for the relationship in the future. This is independent of
the table.
4. Replace variables in equation with information in future cells of table
5. Solve the equation for x, use the solution to answer the question
These five steps can be seen illustrated in the following example.
Example 111.

Sometimes we are given the sum of their ages right now. These problems can be
tricky. In this case we will write the sum above the now column and make the
first person’s age now x. The second person will then turn into the subtraction
problem total x. This is shown in the next example.

A slight variation on age problems is to ask not how old the people are, but
rather ask how long until we have some relationship about their ages. In this case
we alter our table slightly. In the change column because we don’t know the time
to add or subtract we will use a variable, t, and add or subtract this from the now
column. This is shown in the next example.
Example 113.
Louis is 26 years old. Her daughter is 4 years old. In how many years will Louis
be double her daughter’s age?

Age problems have several steps to them. However, if we take the time to work
through each of the steps carefully, keeping the information organized, the prob-
lems can be solved quite nicely.
World View Note: The oldest man in the world was Shigechiyo Izumi from
Japan who lived to be 120 years, 237 days. However, his exact age has been dis-
puted.

Solving Linear Equations - Distance, Rate and Time
Objective: Solve distance problems by creating and solving a linear
equation.
An application of linear equations can be found in distance problems. When
solving distance problems we will use the relationship rt=d or rate (speed) times
time equals distance. For example, if a person were to travel 30 mph for 4 hours.
To find the total distance we would multiply rate times time or (30)(4) = 120.
This person travel a distance of 120 miles. The problems we will be solving here
will be a few more steps than described above. So to keep the information in the
problem organized we will use a table. An example of the basic structure of the
table is blow:
Rate Time Distance
Person 1
Person 2
Table 7. Structure of Distance Problem
The third column, distance, will always be filled in by multiplying the rate and
time columns together. If we are given a total distance of both persons or trips we
will put this information below the distance column. We will now use this table to
set up and solve the following example
79Example 114.
Two joggers start from opposite ends of an 8 mile course running towards each
other. One jogger is running at a rate of 4 mph, and the other is running at a
rate of 6 mph. After how long will the joggers meet?

As the example illustrates, once the table is filled in, the equation to solve is very
easy to find. This same process can be seen in the following example
Example 115.
Bob and Fred start from the same point and walk in opposite directions. Bob
walks 2 miles per hour faster than Fred. After 3 hours they are 30 miles apart.

Some problems will require us to do a bit of work before we can just fill in the
cells. One example of this is if we are given a total time, rather than the indi-
vidual times like we had in the previous example. If we are given total time we
will write this above the time column, use t for the first person’s time, and make
a subtraction problem, Total t, for the second person’s time. This is shown in
−
the next example
Example 116.
Two campers left their campsite by canoe and paddled downstream at an average
speed of 12 mph. They turned around and paddled back upstream at an average
rate of 4 mph. The total trip took 1 hour. After how much time did the campers
turn around downstream?

Another type of a distance problem where we do some work is when one person
catches up with another. Here a slower person has a head start and the faster
person is trying to catch up with him or her and we want to know how long it
will take the fast person to do this. Our startegy for this problem will be to use t
for the faster person’s time, and add amount of time the head start was to get the
slower person’s time. This is shown in the next example.
Example 117.
Mike leaves his house traveling 2 miles per hour. Joy leaves 6 hours later to catch
up with him traveling 8 miles per hour. How long will it take her to catch up
with him?

World View Note: The 10,000 race is the longest standard track event. 10,000
meters is approximately 6.2 miles. The current (at the time of printing) world
record for this race is held by Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele with a time of 26 min-
utes, 17.53 second. That is a rate of 12.7 miles per hour!
As these example have shown, using the table can help keep all the given informa-
tion organized, help fill in the cells, and help find the equation we will solve. The
final example clearly illustrates this.
Example 118.
On a 130 mile trip a car travled at an average speed of 55 mph and then reduced
its speed to 40 mph for the remainder of the trip. The trip took 2.5 hours. For

Graphing - Points and Lines
Objective: Graph points and lines using xy coordinates.
Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation we will make a picture that
represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solu-
tions to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a visual representa-
tion of an equation, we first have to understand the basis of graphing. Following
is an example of what is called the coordinate plane.
The plane is divided into four sections
2 by a horizontal number line (x-axis)
and a vertical number line (y-axis).
1
Where the two lines meet in the center
-4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3
is called the origin. This center origin
-1 is where x = 0 and y = 0. As we move
to the right the numbers count up
-2
from zero, representing x=1,2,3 .
(cid:9)
To the left the numbers count down from zero, representing x = 1, 2, 3 .
− − − (cid:9)
Similarly, as we move up the number count up from zero, y=1,2,3 ., and as we
(cid:9)
move down count down from zero, y = 1, 2, 3. We can put dots on the
− − −
graph which we will call points. Each point has an “address” that defines its loca-
tion. The first number will be the value on the x axis or horizontal number line.
−
This is the distance the point moves left/right from the origin. The second
number will represent the value on the y axis or vertical number line. This is
−
the distance the point moves up/down from the origin. The points are given as an
ordered pair (x,y).
World View Note: Locations on the globe are given in the same manner, each
number is a distance from a central point, the origin which is where the prime
meridian and the equator. This “origin is just off the western coast of Africa.
The following example finds the address or coordinate pair for each of several
points on the coordinate plane.
Example 119.
Give the coordinates of each point.
A
B
C
89Tracing from the origin, point A is 3). C is straight down 2 units. There
right 1, up 4. This becomes A(1, 4). is no left or right. This means we go
Point B is left 5, up 3. Left is back- right zero so the point is C(0, 2).
−
wards or negative so we have B( 5,
−
A(1,4),B( 5,3),C(0, 2) OurSolution
− −
Just as we can give the coordinates for a set of points, we can take a set of points
and plot them on the plane.
Example 120.
Graph the points A(3,2),B( 2,1),C(3, 4),D( 2, 3), E( 3,0),F(0,2),
− − − − −
G(0,0)
The first point, A is at (3, 2) this
A means x=3 (right 3) and y=2 (up 2).
B Following these instructions, starting
Up 2
from the origin, we get our point.
Up 1
Left 2 Right 3
The second point, B( 2, 1), is left 2
−
(negative moves backwards), up 1.
This is also illustrated on the graph.
The third point, C(3, 4) is right 3,
−
down 4 (negative moves backwards).
A
B
Right 3
Left 2
The fourth point, D ( 2, 3) is left
Down 3
Down 4 − −
2, down 3 (both negative, both move
D backwards)
C
The last three points have zeros in them. We still treat these points just like the
other points. If there is a zero there is just no movement.
Next is E( 3,0). This is left 3 (nega-
−
tive is backwards), and up zero, right
F A
B on the x axis.
−
Up 2
Then is F (0, 2). This is right zero,
E Left 3 G and up two, right on the y axis.
−
Finally is G(0, 0). This point has no
D movement. Thus the point is right on
C the origin.

The main purpose of graphs is not to plot random points, but rather to give a
picture of the solutions to an equation. We may have an equation such as y =
2x 3. We may be interested in what type of solution are possible in this equa-
−
tion. We can visualize the solution by making a graph of possible x and y combi-
nations that make this equation a true statement. We will have to start by
finding possible xandy combinations. We will do this using a table of values.

Plot each point.
The graph is our solution
Once the point are on the graph, con-
What this line tells us is that any point on the line will work in the equation y =
2x 3. For example, notice the graph also goes through the point (2,1). If we use
−
x=2, we should get y=1. Sure enough, y=2(2) 3=4 3=1, just as the graph
− −
suggests. Thus we have the line is a picture of all the solutions for y=2x 3. We
−
can use this table of values method to draw a graph of any linear equation.

Graphing - Slope
Objective: Find the slope of a line given a graph or two points.
As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify different properties of the
lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope
is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25, is very steep. A
1
line with a small slope, such as is very flat. We will also use slope to describe
10
the direction of the line. A line that goes up from left to right will have a positive
slope and a line that goes down from left to right will have a negative slope.
As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to
rise
how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction .
run
Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the y-values. Run would be a hor-
izontal change, or a change in the x-values. So another way to describe slope
changeiny
would be the fraction . It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw
changeinx
vertical and horiztonal lines from one point to another to make what is called a
slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope. The following
examples show graphs that we find the slope of using this idea.
Example 123.
To find the slope of this line we will
consider the rise, or verticle change
and the run or horizontal change.

World View Note: When French mathematicians Rene Descartes and Pierre de
Fermat first developed the coordinate plane and the idea of graphing lines (and
other functions) the y-axis was not a verticle line!
Example 124.
95To find the slope of this line, the rise
Run 3
is up 6, the run is right 3. Our slope is
rise 6
then written as a fraction, or .
run 3
This fraction reduces to 2. This will
Rise 6
be our slope.
2 Our Solution
There are two special lines that have unique slopes that we need to be aware of.
They are illustrated in the following example.
Example 125.
In this graph there is no rise, but the
run is 3 units. This slope becomes This line has a rise of 5, but no run.
5
The slope becomes =
0 = 0. This line, undefined. This 0 line,

andallhorizontallineshaveazeroslope. andallverticallines,havenoslope.
As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no
slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first
slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The
second slope can’t get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large
enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.
We can find the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a
graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in y values,
we can calculate this by subtracting the y values of a point. Similarly, if run is a
change in the x values, we can calculate this by subtracting the x values of a
point. In this way we get the following equation for slope.

96When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope.
For this reason we often represent the slope with the variable m. Now we have
the following for slope.

As we subtract the y values and the x values when calculating slope it is impor-
tant we subtract them in the same order. This process is shown in the following
examples.

Again, there is a big difference between no slope and a zero slope. Zero is an
integer and it has a value, the slope of a flat horizontal line. No slope has no
value, it is undefined, the slope of a vertical line.
Using the slope formula we can also find missing points if we know what the slope
is. This is shown in the following two examples.

Graphing - Slope-Intercept Form
Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and y-inter-
cept.
When graphing a line we found one method we could use is to make a table of
values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to
make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is finding the slope and
the y-intercept of the equation. The slope can be represented by m and the y-
intercept, where it crosses the axis and x=0, can be represented by (0,b) where b
is the value where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis. Any other point on the
line can be represented by (x, y). Using this information we will look at the slope
formula and solve the formula for y.
Example 132.

This equation, y=mx+b can be thought of as the equation of any line that as a
slope of m and a y-intercept of b. This formula is known as the slope-intercept
equation.

If we know the slope and the y-intercept we can easily find the equation that rep-
resents the line.

We can also find the equation by looking at a graph and finding the slope and y-

crosses the y-axis (0,3). This means
the y-intercept is 3.

We can also move the opposite direction, using the equation identify the slope
and y-intercept and graph the equation from this information. However, it will be
important for the equation to first be in slope intercept form. If it is not, we will
have to solve it for y so we can identify the slope and the y-intercept.

Once we have an equation in slope-intercept form we can graph it by first plotting
the y-intercept, then using the slope, find a second point and connecting the dots.

103bar graph with a constant slope!

We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to find the next point with
use a coordinate such as (4, 2) to find an individule point. Coordinates such as
−
(4, 2) start from the origin and move horizontally first, and vertically second.
−
Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The
numerator is the vertical change and the denominator is the horizontal change.
Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very different. Zero
slope, or horiztonal line, will simply have a slope of zero which when multiplied
by x gives zero. So the equation simply becomes y=b or y is equal to the y-coor-
dinate of the graph. If we have no slope, or a vertical line, the equation can’t be
written in slope intercept at all because the slope is undefined. There is no y in
these equations. We will simply make x equal to the x-coordinate of the graph.
Example 138.
Give the equation of the line in the

Because we have a vertical line and no
slope there is no slope-intercept equa-
tion we can use. Rather we make x

Graphing - Point-Slope Form
Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and point.
The slope-intercept form has the advantage of being simple to remember and use,
however, it has one major disadvantage: we must know the y-intercept in order to
use it! Generally we do not know the y-intercept, we only know one or more
points (that are not the y-intercept). In these cases we can’t use the slope inter-
cept equation, so we will use a different more flexible formula. If we let the slope
of an equation be m, and a specific point on the line be (x , y ), and any other
1 1
point on the line be (x, y). We can use the slope formula to make a second equa-
tion.

Often, we will prefer final answers be written in slope intercept form. If the direc-
107tions ask for the answer in slope-intercept form we will simply distribute the
slope, then solve for y.

An important thing to observe about the point slope formula is that the operation
between the x’s and y’s is subtraction. This means when you simplify the signs
you will have the opposite of the numbers in the point. We need to be very
careful with signs as we use the point-slope formula.
In order to find the equation of a line we will always need to know the slope. If
we don’t know the slope to begin with we will have to do some work to find it
first before we can get an equation.

World View Note: The city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) had a
river that flowed through the city breaking it into several parts. There were 7
bridges that connected the parts of the city. In 1735 Leonhard Euler considered
the question of whether it was possible to cross each bridge exactly once and only
once. It turned out that this problem was impossible, but the work laid the foun-
dation of what would become graph theory.

Graphing - Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Objective: Identify the equation of a line given a parallel or perpendic-
ular line.
There is an interesting connection between the slope of lines that are parallel and
the slope of lines that are perpendicular (meet at a right angle). This is shown in
the following example.
Example 145.
The above graph has two parallel The above graph has two perpendic-
lines. The slope of the top line is ular lines. The slope of the flatter line
down 2, run 3, or 2 . The slope of is up 2, run 3 or

World View Note: Greek Mathematician Euclid lived around 300 BC and pub-
lished a book titled, The Elements. In it is the famous parallel postulate which
mathematicians have tried for years to drop from the list of postulates. The
attempts have failed, yet all the work done has developed new types of geome-
tries!
As the above graphs illustrate, parallel lines have the same slope and perpendic-
ular lines have opposite (one positive, one negative) reciprocal (flipped fraction)
slopes. We can use these properties to make conclusions about parallel and per-
pendicular lines.

Once we have a slope, it is possible to find the complete equation of the second
line if we know one point on the second line.

Zero slopes and no slopes may seem like opposites (one is a horizontal line, one is
a vertical line). Because a horizontal line is perpendicular to a vertical line we can
say that no slope and zero slope are actually perpendicular slopes!

Inequalities - Solve and Graph Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution to
linear inequalities.
When we have an equation such as x=4 we have a specific value for our variable.
With inequalities we will give a range of values for our variable. To do this we
will not use equals, but one of the following symbols:
> Greaterthan
> Greaterthanorequalto
< Lessthan
6 Lessthanorequalto
World View Note: English mathematician Thomas Harriot first used the above
symbols in 1631. However, they were not immediately accepted as symbols such
as ⊏ and ⊐ were already coined by another English mathematician, William
Oughtred.
If we have an expression such as x<4, this means our variable can be any number
smaller than 4 such as 2, 0, 3, 3.9 or even 3.999999999 as long as it is smaller
−
118than 4. If we have an expression such as x > 2, this means our variable can be
−
any number greater than or equal to 2,suchas5,0, 1, 1.9999,oreven 2.
− − − −
Because we don’t have one set value for our variable, it is often useful to draw a
picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. We will start from the
value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is
smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the vari-
able is larger. The value itself we will mark with brackets, either ) or ( for less
than or greater than respectively, and ] or [ for less than or equal to or greater
than or equal to respectively.
Once the graph is drawn we can quickly convert the graph into what is called
interval notation. Interval notation gives two numbers, the first is the smallest
value, the second is the largest value. If there is no largest value, we can use
∞
(infinity). If there is no smallest value, we can use negative infinity. If we
− ∞
use either positive or negative infinity we will always use a curved bracket for that
value.

We can also take a graph and find the inequality for it.

Generally when we are graphing and giving interval notation for an inequality we
will have to first solve the inequality for our variable. Solving inequalities is very
similar to solving equations with one exception. Consider the following inequality
and what happens when various operations are done to it. Notice what happens
to the inequality sign as we add, subtract, multiply and divide by both positive
and negative numbers to keep the statment a true statement.

18< 12 Dividebothsidesby 6
− − −
3>2 Symbolflippedwhenwemultiplyordividebyanegative!
As the above problem illustrates, we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide on
both sides of the inequality. But if we multiply or divide by a negative number,
the symbol will need to flip directions. We will keep that in mind as we solve
inequalities.

The inequality we solve can get as complex as the linear equations we solved. We
will use all the same patterns to solve these inequalities as we did for solving
equations. Just remember that any time we multiply or divide by a negative the
symbol switches directions (multiplying or dividing by a positive does not change
the symbol!)

It is important to be careful when the inequality is written backwards as in the
previous example (4<x rather than x>4). Often students draw their graphs the
wrong way when this is the case. The inequality symbol opens to the variable,
this means the variable is greater than 4. So we must shade above the 4.

Inequalities - Compound Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation to the solution of
compound inequalities.
Several inequalities can be combined together to form what are called compound
inequalities. There are three types of compound inequalities which we will investi-
gate in this lesson.
The first type of a compound inequality is an OR inequality. For this type of
inequality we want a true statment from either one inequality OR the other
inequality OR both. When we are graphing these type of inequalities we will
graph each individual inequality above the number line, then move them both
down together onto the actual number line for our graph that combines them
together.
When we give interval notation for our solution, if there are two different parts to
the graph we will put a (union) symbol between two sets of interval notation,
∪
one for each part.

World View Note: The symbol for infinity was first used by the Romans,
although at the time the number was used for 1000. The greeks also used the
symbol for 10,000.
There are several different results that could result from an OR statement. The
graphs could be pointing different directions, as in the graph above, or pointing in
the same direction as in the graph below on the left, or pointing opposite direc-
tions, but overlapping as in the graph below on the right. Notice how interval
notation works for each of these cases.
124As the graphs overlap, we take the When the graphs are combined they

−∞ −∞ ∞
The second type of compound inequality is an AND inequality. AND inequalities
require both statements to be true. If one is false, they both are false. When we
graph these inequalities we can follow a similar process, first graph both inequali-
ties above the number line, but this time only where they overlap will be drawn
onto the number line for our final graph. When our solution is given in interval
notation it will be expressed in a manner very similar to single inequalities (there
is a symbol that can be used for AND, the intersection - , but we will not use it
∩
here).
Example 158.
Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and express it interval notation.

(2,5] IntervalNotation
Again, as we graph AND inequalities, only the overlapping parts of the individual
graphs makes it to the final number line. As we graph AND inequalities there are
also three different types of results we could get. The first is shown in the above
125example. The second is if the arrows both point the same way, this is shown
below on the left. The third is if the arrows point opposite ways but don’t
overlap, this is shown below on the right. Notice how interval notation is
expressed in each case.
In this graph, the overlap is only the In this graph there is no overlap of the
smaller graph, so this is what makes it parts. Because their is no overlap, no
to the final number line. values make it to the final number
line.

Interval Notation: No Solution or ∅
The third type of compound inequality is a special type of AND inequality. When
our variable (or expression containing the variable) is between two numbers, we
can write it as a single math sentence with three parts, such as 5<x68, to show
x is between 5 and 8 (or equal to 8). When solving these type of inequalities,
because there are three parts to work with, to stay balanced we will do the same
thing to all three parts (rather than just both sides) to isolate the variable in the
middle. The graph then is simply the values between the numbers with appro-
priate brackets on the ends.

Inequalities - Absolute Value Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation for the solution to
inequalities with absolute values.
When an inequality has an absolute value we will have to remove the absolute
value in order to graph the solution or give interval notation. The way we remove
the absolute value depends on the direction of the inequality symbol.
Consider x <2.
| |
Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this
inequality would be the distance from zero is less than 2. So on a number line we
will shade all points that are less than 2 units away from zero.
This graph looks just like the graphs of the three part compound inequalities!
When the absolute value is less than a number we will remove the absolute value
by changing the problem to a three part inequality, with the negative value on the
left and the positive value on the right. So x < 2 becomes 2 < x < 2, as the
| | −
graph above illustrates.
Consider x >2.
| |
Absolute value is defined as distance from zero. Another way to read this
inequality would be the distance from zero is greater than 2. So on the number
line we shade all points that are more than 2 units away from zero.
This graph looks just like the graphs of the OR compound inequalities! When the
absolute value is greater than a number we will remove the absolute value by
changing the problem to an OR inequality, the first inequality looking just like
the problem with no absolute value, the second flipping the inequality symbol and
changing the value to a negative. So x >2becomesx>2orx< 2, as the graph
| | −
above illustrates.
World View Note: The phrase “absolute value” comes from German mathemati-
cian Karl Weierstrass in 1876, though he used the absolute value symbol for com-
plex numbers. The first known use of the symbol for integers comes from a 1939
128edition of a college algebra text!
For all absolute value inequalities we can also express our answers in interval
notation which is done the same way it is done for standard compound inequali-
ties.
We can solve absolute value inequalities much like we solved absolute value equa-
tions. Our first step will be to isolate the absolute value. Next we will remove the
absolute value by making a three part inequality if the absolute value is less than
a number, or making an OR inequality if the absolute value is greater than a
number. Then we will solve these inequalites. Remember, if we multiply or divide
by a negative the inequality symbol will switch directions!

In the previous example, we cannot distribute the 2 into the absolute value.

We can never distribute or combine things outside the absolute value with what is
inside the absolute value. Our only way to solve is to first isolate the absolute
value by clearing the values around it, then either make a compound inequality
(and OR or a three part) to solve.
130It is important to remember as we are solving these equations, the absolute value
is always positive. If we end up with an absolute value is less than a negative
number, then we will have no solution because absolute value will always be posi-
tive, greater than a negative. Similarly, if absolute value is greater than a nega-
tive, this will always happen. Here the answer will be all real numbers.

Systems of Equations - Graphing
Objective: Solve systems of equations by graphing and identifying the
point of intersection.
We have solved problems like 3x 4 = 11 by adding 4 to both sides and then
−
dividing by 3 (solution is x = 5). We also have methods to solve equations with
more than one variable in them. It turns out that to solve for more than one vari-
able we will need the same number of equations as variables. For example, to
solve for two variables such as xand y we will need two equations. When we have
several equations we are using to solve, we call the equations a system of equa-
tions. When solving a system of equations we are looking for a solution that
works in both equations. This solution is usually given as an ordered pair (x, y).
The following example illustrates a solution working in both equations
Example 165.
3x y=5

−
6 1=5 Evaluate
−
5=5 True
(2)+(1)=3 Secondequation,evaluate
3=3 True
As we found a true statement for both equations we know (2,1) is the solution to
the system. It is in fact the only combination of numbers that works in both
equations. In this lesson we will be working to find this point given the equations.
It seems to follow that if we use points to describe the solution, we can use graphs
to find the solutions.
If the graph of a line is a picture of all the solutions, we can graph two lines on
the same coordinate plane to see the solutions of both equations. We are inter-
134ested in the point that is a solution for both lines, this would be where the lines
intersect! If we can find the intersection of the lines we have found the solution
that works in both equations.

(4,1) to get the next point and connect the
dots.
Remember a negative slope is down-
hill!
Find the intersection point, (4,1)
(4,1) Our Solution
Often our equations won’t be in slope-intercept form and we will have to solve
both equations for y first so we can idenfity the slope and y-intercept.

The two lines do not intersect! They
are parallel! If the lines do not inter-
sect we know that there is no point
that works in both equations, there is
no solution
∅NoSolution
We also could have noticed that both lines had the same slope. Remembering
136that parallel lines have the same slope we would have known there was no solu-
tion even without having to graph the lines.

Both equations are the same line! As
one line is directly on top of the other
line, we can say that the lines “inter-
sect” at all the points! Here we say we
have infinite solutions
Once we had both equations in slope-intercept form we could have noticed that
the equations were the same. At this point we could have stated that there are
infinite solutions without having to go through the work of graphing the equa-
tions.
World View Note: The Babylonians were the first to work with systems of
equations with two variables. However, their work with systems was quickly
passed by the Greeks who would solve systems of equations with three or four
variables and around 300 AD, developed methods for solving systems with any
number of unknowns!

Systems of Equations - Substitution
Objective: Solve systems of equations using substitution.
When solving a system by graphing has several limitations. First, it requires the
graph to be perfectly drawn, if the lines are not straight we may arrive at the
wrong answer. Second, graphing is not a great method to use if the answer is
really large, over 100 for example, or if the answer is a decimal the that graph will
not help us find, 3.2134 for example. For these reasons we will rarely use graphing
to solve our systems. Instead, an algebraic approach will be used.
The first algebraic approach is called substitution. We will build the concepts of
substitution through several example, then end with a five-step process to solve
problems using this method.
Example 170.

−
y=7 Wenowalsohavey
(5,7) OurSolution
When we know what one variable equals we can plug that value (or expression) in
for the variable in the other equation. It is very important that when we substi-
tute, the substituted value goes in parenthesis. The reason for this is shown in the
next example.

−
(2, 1) OurSolution
−
By using the entire expression 3x 7 to replace y in the other equation we were
−
able to reduce the system to a single linear equation which we can easily solve for
our first variable. However, the lone variable (a variable without a coefficient) is
not always alone on one side of the equation. If this happens we can isolate it by
solving for the lone variable.

Just as with graphing it is possible to have no solution ∅ (parallel lines) or
infinite solutions (same line) with the substitution method. While we won’t have
a parallel line or the same line to look at and conclude if it is one or the other,
the process takes an interesting turn as shown in the following example.

Because we had a true statement, and no variables, we know that anything that
works in the first equation, will also work in the second equation. However, we do
not always end up with a true statement.

Because we had a false statement, and no variables, we know that nothing will

142World View Note: French mathematician Rene Descartes wrote a book which
included an appendix on geometry. It was in this book that he suggested using
letters from the end of the alphabet for unknown values. This is why often we are
solving for the variables x,y,andz.
One more question needs to be considered, what if there is no lone variable? If
there is no lone variable substitution can still work to solve, we will just have to
select one variable to solve for and use fractions as we solve.

Systems of Equations - Addition/Elimination
Objective: Solve systems of equations using the addition/elimination
method.
When solving systems we have found that graphing is very limited when solving
equations. We then considered a second method known as substituion. This is
probably the most used idea in solving systems in various areas of algebra. How-
ever, substitution can get ugly if we don’t have a lone variable. This leads us to
our second method for solving systems of equations. This method is known as
either Elimination or Addition. We will set up the process in the following exam-
ples, then define the five step process we can use to solve by elimination.

In the previous example one variable had opposites in front of it, 4y and 4y.
−
Adding these together eliminated the y completely. This allowed us to solve for
the x. This is the idea behind the addition method. However, generally we won’t
have opposites in front of one of the variables. In this case we will manipulate the
equations to get the opposites we want by multiplying one or both equations (on
both sides!). This is shown in the next example.

to get the opposites we were looking for. What we are looking for with our oppo-
sites is the least common multiple (LCM) of the coefficients. We also could have
solved the above problem by looking at the terms with y, 5yand3y. The LCM of
3 and 5 is 15. So we would want to multiply both equations, the 5y by 3, and the
3y by 5 to get opposites, 15y and 15y. This illustrates an important point,

mula very similar to Gaussian elimination which is very similar to the addition
method.
148Just as with graphing and substution, it is possible to have no solution or infinite
solutions with elimination. Just as with substitution, if the variables all disappear
from our problem, a true statment will indicate infinite solutions and a false stat-
ment will indicate no solution.

We have covered three different methods that can be used to solve a system of
two equations with two variables. While all three can be used to solve any
system, graphing works great for small integer solutions. Substitution works great
when we have a lone variable, and addition works great when the other two
methods fail. As each method has its own strengths, it is important you are
familiar with all three methods.

Systems of Equations - Three Variables
Objective: Solve systems of equations with three variables using addi-
tion/elimination.
Solving systems of equations with 3 variables is very similar to how we solve sys-
tems with two variables. When we had two variables we reduced the system down
to one with only one variable (by substitution or addition). With three variables
we will reduce the system down to one with two variables (usually by addition),
which we can then solve by either addition or substitution.
To reduce from three variables down to two it is very important to keep the work
organized. We will use addition with two equations to eliminate one variable.
This new equation we will call (A). Then we will use a different pair of equations
and use addition to eliminate the same variable. This second new equation we
will call (B). Once we have done this we will have two equations (A) and (B)
with the same two variables that we can solve using either method. This is shown
in the following examples.

As we are solving for x,y,andz we will have an ordered triplet (x,y,z) instead of
152just the ordered pair (x, y). In this above problem, y was easily eliminated using
the addition method. However, sometimes we may have to do a bit of work to get
a variable to eliminate. Just as with addition of two equations, we may have to
multiply equations by something on both sides to get the opposites we want so a
variable eliminates. As we do this remmeber it is improtant to eliminate the
same variable both times using two different pairs of equations.

Equations with three (or more) variables are not any more difficult than two vari-
ables if we are careful to keep our information organized and eliminate the same
variable twice using two different pairs of equations. It is possible to solve each
system several different ways. We can use different pairs of equations or eliminate
variables in different orders, but as long as our information is organized and our
algebra is correct, we will arrive at the same final solution.

Systems of Equations - Value Problems
Objective: Solve value problems by setting up a system of equations.
One application of system of equations are known as value problems. Value prob-
lems are ones where each variable has a value attached to it. For example, if our
variable is the number of nickles in a person’s pocket, those nickles would have a
value of five cents each. We will use a table to help us set up and solve value
problems. The basic structure of the table is shown below.
Number Value Total
Item1
Item2
Total
The first column in the table is used for the number of things we have. Quite
often, this will be our variables. The second column is used for the that value
each item has. The third column is used for the total value which we calculate by
multiplying the number by the value. For example, if we have 7 dimes, each with
a value of 10 cents, the total value is 7 10=70 cents. The last row of the table is
·
for totals. We only will use the third row (also marked total) for the totals that
158are given to use. This means sometimes this row may have some blanks in it.
Once the table is filled in we can easily make equations by adding each column,
setting it equal to the total at the bottom of the column. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example.
Example 186.
In a child’s bank are 11 coins that have a value of S1.85. The coins are either
quarters or dimes. How many coins each does child have?

World View Note: American coins are the only coins that do not state the
value of the coin. On the back of the dime it says “one dime” (not 10 cents). On
the back of the quarter it says “one quarter” (not 25 cents). On the penny it
says “one cent” (not 1 cent). The rest of the world (Euros, Yen, Pesos, etc) all
write the value as a number so people who don’t speak the language can easily
use the coins.
Ticket sales also have a value. Often different types of tickets sell for different
prices (values). These problems can be solve in much the same way.
Example 187.
There were 41 tickets sold for an event. Tickets for children cost S1.50 and tickets
for adults cost S2.00. Total receipts for the event were S73.50. How many of each
type of ticket were sold?

Some problems will not give us the total number of items we have. Instead they
will give a relationship between the items. Here we will have statements such
as “There are twice as many dimes as nickles”. While it is clear that we need to
multiply one variable by 2, it may not be clear which variable gets multiplied by
2. Generally the equations are backwards from the English sentence. If there are
twice as many dimes, than we multiply the other variable (nickels) by two. So the
equation would be d=2n. This type of problem is in the next example.
Example 188.
A man has a collection of stamps made up of 5 cent stamps and 8 cent stamps.
There are three times as many 8 cent stamps as 5 cent stamps. The total value of
all the stamps is S3.48. How many of each stamp does he have?

The same process for solving value problems can be applied to solving interest
problems. Our table titles will be adjusted slightly as we do so.
Invest Rate Interest

Our first column is for the amount invested in each account. The second column
is the interest rate earned (written as a decimal - move decimal point twice left),
and the last column is for the amount of interset earned. Just as before, we mul-
tiply the investment amount by the rate to find the final column, the interest
earned. This is shown in the following example.
Example 189.
A woman invests S4000 in two accounts, one at 6% interest, the other at 9%
interest for one year. At the end of the year she had earned S270 in interest. How
much did she have invested in each account?

Systems of Equations - Mixture Problems
Objective: Solve mixture problems by setting up a system of equations.
One application of systems of equations are mixture problems. Mixture problems
are ones where two different solutions are mixed together resulting in a new final
solution. We will use the following table to help us solve mixture problems:
Amount Part Total
Item1
Item2
Final
The first column is for the amount of each item we have. The second column is
labeled “part”. If we mix percentages we will put the rate (written as a decimal)
in this column. If we mix prices we will put prices in this column. Then we can
multiply the amount by the part to find the total. Then we can get an equation
by adding the amount and/or total columns that will help us solve the problem
and answer the questions.
These problems can have either one or two variables. We will start with one vari-
able problems.
Example 191.
A chemist has 70 mL of a 50% methane solution. How much of a 80% solution
must she add so the final solution is 60% methane?

attached to them, rather than a percentage.

with two unknown values. The following example is one such problem.

Polynomials - Exponent Properties
Objective: Simplify expressions using the properties of exponents.
Problems with expoenents can often be simplified using a few basic exponent
properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to
discover the important properties.
World View Note: The word exponent comes from the Latin “expo” meaning
out of and “ponere” meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the
Babylonians living in Iraq were the first to do work with exponents (dating back
to the 23rd century BC or earlier!)
Example 196.

A quicker method to arrive at our answer would have been to just add the expo-
nents: a3a2=a3+2=a5 This is known as the product rule of exponents
ProductRuleofExponents:aman=am+n
The product rule of exponents can be used to simplify many problems. We will
add the exponent on like variables. This is shown in the following examples

The quotient rule of exponents can similarly be used to simplify exponent prob-
lems by subtracting exponents on like variables. This is shown in the following
examples.

This property is often combined with two other properties which we will investi-
gate now.

178A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to take the exponent
of three and put it on each factor in parenthesis, (ab)3 = a3b3. This is known as
the power of a product rule or exponents.
Powerof aProductRuleofExponents:(ab)m=ambm
It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multipli-
cation inside parenthesis. This property does NOT work if there is addition or
subtraction.

The power of a power, product and quotient rules are often used together to sim-
plify expressions. This is shown in the following examples.

OurSolution
c8d10
As we multiply exponents its important to remember these properties apply to
exponents, not bases. An expressions such as 53 does not mean we multipy 5 by 3,
rather we multiply 5 three times, 5 5 5 = 125. This is shown in the next
× ×
example.
Example 208.
(4x2y5)3 Puttheexponentof3oneachfactor,multiplyingpowers
43x6y15 Evaluate43
64x6y15 OurSolution
In the previous example we did not put the 3 on the 4 and multipy to get 12, this
would have been incorrect. Never multipy a base by the exponent. These proper-
ties pertain to exponents only, not bases.
In this lesson we have discussed 5 different exponent properties. These rules are
summarized in the following table.

These five properties are often mixed up in the same problem. Often there is a bit
of flexibility as to which property is used first. However, order of operations still
applies to a problem. For this reason it is the suggestion of the auther to simplify
inside any parenthesis first, then simplify any exponents (using power rules), and
finally simplify any multiplication or division (using product and quotient rules).
This is illustrated in the next few examples.

Polynomials - Negative Exponents
Objective: Simplify expressions with negative exponents using the
properties of exponents.
There are a few special exponent properties that deal with exponents that are not
positive. The first is considered in the following example, which is worded out 2
different ways:

This final result is an imporant property known as the zero power rule of expo-

Any number or expression raised to the zero power will always be 1. This is illus-
trated in the following example.

This example illustrates an important property of exponents. Negative exponents
yield the reciprocal of the base. Once we take the reciprical the exponent is now
positive. Also, it is important to note a negative exponent does not mean the
expression is negative, only that we need the reciprocal of the base. Following are
the rules of negative exponents

(cid:16) (cid:17)
Negative exponents can be combined in several different ways. As a general rule if
we think of our expression as a fraction, negative exponents in the numerator
must be moved to the denominator, likewise, negative exponents in the denomi-
nator need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exponent moves,
the exponent is now positive. This is illustrated in the following example.
Example 217.

OurSolution
2b2f2
184As we simplified our fraction we took special care to move the bases that had a
negative exponent, but the expression itself did not become negative because of
those exponents. Also, it is important to remember that exponents only effect
what they are attached to. The 2 in the denominator of the above example does
not have an exponent on it, so it does not move with the d.
We now have the following nine properties of exponents. It is important that we
are very familiar with all of them.

World View Note: Nicolas Chuquet, the French mathematician of the 15th cen-
tury wrote 121m¯ to indicate 12x 1. This was the first known use of the negative
−
exponent.
Simplifying with negative exponents is much the same as simplifying with positive
exponents. It is the advice of the author to keep the negative exponents until the
end of the problem and then move them around to their correct location (numer-
ator or denominator). As we do this it is important to be very careful of rules for
adding, subtracting, and multiplying with negatives. This is illustrated in the fol-
lowing examples

we moved the three to the denominator and the exponent became positive. We
did not make the number negative! Negative exponents never make the bases neg-
ative, they simply mean we have to take the reciprocal of the base. One final
example with negative exponents is given here.

Polynomials - Scientific Notation
Objective: Multiply and divide expressions using scientific notation and
exponent properties.
One application of exponent properties comes from scientific notation. Scientific
notation is used to represent really large or really small numbers. An example of
really large numbers would be the distance that light travels in a year in miles.
An example of really small numbers would be the mass of a single hydrogen atom
in grams. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these
numbers would normally be very combersome. However, our exponent properties
make this process much simpler.
First we will take a look at what scientific notation is. Scientific notation has two
parts, a number between one and ten (it can be equal to one, but not ten), and
that number multiplied by ten to some exponent.
ScientificNotation:a 10bwhere16a<10
×
The exponent, b, is very important to how we convert between scientific notation
and normal numbers, or standard notation. The exponent tells us how many
times we will multiply by 10. Multiplying by 10 in affect moves the decimal point
one place. So the exponent will tell us how many times the exponent moves
between scientific notation and standard notation. To decide which direction to
move the decimal (left or right) we simply need to remember that positive expo-
nents mean in standard notation we have a big number (bigger than ten) and neg-
ative exponents mean in standard notation we have a small number (less than
one).
Keeping this in mind, we can easily make conversions between standard notation
and scientific notation.

Converting between standard notation and scientific notation is important to
understand how scientific notation works and what it does. Here our main
interest is to be able to multiply and divide numbers in scientific notation using
exponent properties. The way we do this is first do the operation with the front
number (multiply or divide) then use exponent properties to simplify the 10’s.
Scientific notation is the only time where it will be allowed to have negative expo-
nents in our final solution. The negative exponent simply informs us that we are
dealing with small numbers. Consider the following examples.

Often when we multiply or divide in scientific notation the end result is not in sci-
entific notation. We will then have to convert the front number into scientific
notation and then combine the 10’s using the product property of exponents and
adding the exponents. This is shown in the following examples.

World View Note: Archimedes (287 BC - 212 BC), the Greek mathematician,
developed a system for representing large numbers using a system very similar to
scientific notation. He used his system to calculate the number of grains of sand it
would take to fill the universe. His conclusion was 1063 grains of sand because he
figured the universe to have a diameter of 1014 stadia or about 2 light years.

Polynomials - Introduction to Polynomials
Objective: Evaluate, add, and subtract polynomials.
Many applications in mathematics have to do with what are called polynomials.
Polynomials are made up of terms. Terms are a product of numbers and/or vari-
ables. For example, 5x, 2y2, 5, ab3c, and x are all terms. Terms are connected
−
to each other by addition or subtraction. Expressions are often named based on
the number of terms in them. A monomial has one term, such as 3x2. A bino-
mial has two terms, such as a2 b2. A Trinomial has three terms, such as ax2 +
−
bx + c. The term polynomial means many terms. Monomials, binomials, trino-
mials, and expressions with more terms all fall under the umbrella of “polyno-
mials”.
If we know what the variable in a polynomial represents we can replace the vari-
able with the number and evaluate the polynomial as shown in the following
example.
Example 230.
2x2 4x+6whenx= 4 Replacevariablexwith 4

− −

54 OurSolution
It is important to be careful with negative variables and exponents. Remember
the exponent only effects the number it is physically attached to. This means
−
32= 9 because the exponent is only attached to the 3. Also, ( 3)2=9 because
− −
the exponent is attached to the parenthesis and effects everything inside. When
we replace a variable with parenthesis like in the previous example, the substi-
tuted value is in parenthesis. So the ( 4)2 = 16 in the example. However, con-

192World View Note: Ada Lovelace in 1842 described a Difference Engine that
would be used to caluclate values of polynomials. Her work became the founda-
tion for what would become the modern computer (the programming language
Ada was named in her honor), more than 100 years after her death from cancer.
Generally when working with polynomials we do not know the value of the vari-
able, so we will try and simplify instead. The simplest operation with polynomials
is addition. When adding polynomials we are mearly combining like terms. Con-
sider the following example
Example 232.

− − − −
7x3 9x2 2x 3 OurSolution
− − −
Generally final answers for polynomials are written so the exponent on the vari-
able counts down. Example 3 demonstrates this with the exponent counting down
3, 2, 1, 0 (recall x0=1). Subtracting polynomials is almost as fast. One extra step
comes from the minus in front of the parenthesis. When we have a negative in
front of parenthesis we distribute it through, changing the signs of everything
inside. The same is done for the subtraction sign.

Polynomials - Multiplying Polynomials
Objective: Multiply polynomials.
Multiplying polynomials can take several different forms based on what we are
multiplying. We will first look at multiplying monomials, then monomials by
polynomials and finish with polynomials by polynomials.
Multiplying monomials is done by multiplying the numbers or coefficients and
then adding the exponents on like factors. This is shown in the next example.
Example 235.
(4x3y4z)(2x2y6z3) Multiplynumbersandaddexponentsforx,y,andz
8x5y10z4 OurSolution
In the previous example it is important to remember that the z has an exponent
of 1 when no exponent is written. Thus for our answer the z has an exponent of
1+3=4. Be very careful with exponents in polynomials. If we are adding or sub-
tracting the exponnets will stay the same, but when we multiply (or divide) the
exponents will be changing.
Next we consider multiplying a monomial by a polynomial. We have seen this
operation before with distributing through parenthesis. Here we will see the exact
same process.
Example 236.
4x3(5x2 2x+5) Distributethe4x3,multiplyingnumbers,addingexponents
−
20x5 8x4+20x3 OurSolution
−
Following is another example with more variables. When distributing the expo-
nents on a are added and the exponents on b are added.
Example 237.
2a3b(3ab2 4a) Distribute,multiplyingnumbersandaddingexponents
−
6a4b3 8a4b OurSolution
−
There are several different methods for multiplying polynomials. All of which
work, often students prefer the method they are first taught. Here three methods
will be discussed. All three methods will be used to solve the same two multipli-
cation problems.
Multiply by Distributing
196Just as we distribute a monomial through parenthesis we can distribute an entire
polynomial. As we do this we take each term of the second polynomial and put it
in front of the first polynomial.
Example 238.
(4x+7y)(3x 2y) Distribute(4x+7y)throughparenthesis
−
3x(4x+7y) 2y(4x+7y) Distributethe3xand 2y
− −
12x2+21xy 8xy 14y2 Combineliketerms21xy 8xy
− − −
12x2+13xy 14y2 OurSolution
−
This example illustrates an important point, the negative/subtraction sign stays
with the 2y. Which means on the second step the negative is also distributed
through the last set of parenthesis.
Multiplying by distributing can easily be extended to problems with more terms.
First distribute the front parenthesis onto each term, then distribute again!
Example 239.
(2x 5)(4x2 7x+3) Distribute(2x 5)throughparenthesis
− − −
4x2(2x 5) 7x(2x 5)+3(2x 5) Distributeagainthrougheachparenthesis
− − − −
8x3 20x2 14x2+35x+6x 15 Combineliketerms
− − −
8x3 34x2+41x 15 OurSolution
− −
This process of multiplying by distributing can easily be reversed to do an impor-
tant procedure known as factoring. Factoring will be addressed in a future lesson.
Multiply by FOIL
Another form of multiplying is known as FOIL. Using the FOIL method we mul-
tiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. The
letters of FOIL help us remember every combination. F stands for First, we mul-
tiply the first term of each binomial. O stand for Outside, we multiply the outside
two terms. I stands for Inside, we multiply the inside two terms. L stands for
Last, we multiply the last term of each binomial. This is shown in the next
example:
Example 240.
(4x+7y)(3x 2y) UseFOILtomultiply
−
(4x)(3x)=12x2 F Firstterms(4x)(3x)

(4x)( 2y)= 8xy O Outsideterms(4x)( 2y)

12x2+13xy 14y2 OurSolution
−
197Some students like to think of the FOIL method as distributing the first term 4x
through the (3x 2y) and distributing the second term 7y through the (3x 2y).
− −
Thinking about FOIL in this way makes it possible to extend this method to
problems with more terms.
Example 241.
(2x 5)(4x2 7x+3) Distribute2xand 5
− − −
(2x)(4x2)+(2x)( 7x)+(2x)(3) 5(4x2) 5( 7x) 5(3) Multiplyouteachterm

− − −
8x3 34x2+41x 15 OurSolution
− −
The second step of the FOIL method is often not written, for example, consider
the previous example, a student will often go from the problem (4x+7y)(3x 2y)
−
and do the multiplication mentally to come up with 12x2 8xy+21xy 14y2 and
− −
then combine like terms to come up with the final solution.
Multiplying in rows
A third method for multiplying polynomials looks very similar to multiplying
numbers. Consider the problem:

World View Note: The first known system that used place values comes from
Chinese mathematics, dating back to 190 AD or earlier.
The same process can be done with polynomials. Multiply each term on the
bottom with each term on the top.

This method of multiplying in rows also works with multiplying a monomial by a
polynomial!
Any of the three described methods work to multiply polynomials. It is suggested
that you are very comfortable with at least one of these methods as you work
through the practice problems. All three methods are shown side by side in the
example.
Example 244.

When we are multiplying a monomial by a polynomial by a polynomial we can
solve by first multiplying the polynomials then distributing the coefficient last.
This is shown in the last example.
Example 245.

A common error students do is distribute the three at the start into both paren-
thesis. While we can distribute the 3 into the (2x 4) factor, distributing into
−
both would be wrong. Be careful of this error. This is why it is suggested to mul-
tiply the binomials first, then distribute the coeffienct last.

Polynomials - Multiply Special Products
Objective: Recognize and use special product rules of a sum and differ-
ence and perfect squares to multiply polynomials.
There are a few shortcuts that we can take when multiplying polynomials. If we
can recognize them the shortcuts can help us arrive at the solution much quicker.
These shortcuts will also be useful to us as our study of algebra continues.
The first shortcut is often called a sum and a difference. A sum and a differ-
ence is easily recognized as the numbers and variables are exactly the same, but
the sign in the middle is different (one sum, one difference). To illustrate the
shortcut consider the following example, multiplied by the distributing method.
Example 246.
(a+b)(a b) Distribute(a+b)
−
a(a+b) b(a+b) Distributeaand b
− −
a2+ab ab b2 Combineliketermsab ab
− − −
a2 b2 OurSolution
−
The important part of this example is the middle terms subtracted to zero.
Rather than going through all this work, when we have a sum and a difference we
will jump right to our solution by squaring the first term and squaring the last
term, putting a subtraction between them. This is illustrated in the following
example
Example 247.
(x 5)(x+5) Recognizesumanddifference
−
x2 25 Squareboth,putsubtractionbetween.OurSolution
−
This is much quicker than going through the work of multiplying and combining
like terms. Often students ask if they can just multiply out using another method
and not learn the shortcut. These shortcuts are going to be very useful when we
get to factoring polynomials, or reversing the multiplication process. For this
reason it is very important to be able to recognize these shortcuts. More examples
are shown here.

Example 249.

−
It is interesting to note that while we can multiply and get an answer like a2 b2
−
(with subtraction), it is impossible to multiply real numbers and end up with a
product such as a2+b2 (with addition).
Another shortcut used to multiply is known as a perfect square. These are easy
to recognize as we will have a binomial with a 2 in the exponent. The following
example illustrates multiplying a perfect square
Example 250.
(a+b)2 Squaredissameasmultiplyingbyitself
(a+b)(a+b) Distribute(a+b)
a(a+b)+b(a+b) Distributeagainthroughfinalparenthesis
a2+ab+ab+b2 Combineliketermsab+ab
a2+2ab+b2 OurSolution
This problem also helps us find our shortcut for multiplying. The first term in the
answer is the square of the first term in the problem. The middle term is 2 times
the first term times the second term. The last term is the square of the last term.
This can be shortened to square the first, twice the product, square the last. If we
can remember this shortcut we can square any binomial. This is illustrated in the
following example
Example 251.
(x 5)2 Recognizeperfectsquare

x2 Squarethefirst
2(x)( 5)= 10x Twicetheproduct
− −
( 5)2=25 Squarethelast
−
x2 10x+25 OurSolution
−
202Be very careful when we are squaring a binomial to NOT distribute the square
through the parenthesis. A common error is to do the following: (x 5)2=x2 25
− −
(or x2 + 25). Notice both of these are missing the middle term, 10x. This is
−
why it is important to use the shortcut to help us find the correct solution.
Another important observation is that the middle term in the solution always has
the same sign as the middle term in the problem. This is illustrated in the next
examples.
Example 252.
(2x+5)2 Recognizeperfectsquare
(2x)2=4x2 Squarethefirst

These two formulas will be important to commit to memory. The more familiar
we are with them, the easier factoring, or multiplying in reverse, will be. The final
example covers both types of problems (two perfect squares, one positive, one
negative), be sure to notice the difference between the examples and how each for-
mula is used

World View Note: There are also formulas for higher powers of binomials as
well, such as (a+b)3=a3+3a2b+3ab2+b3. While French mathematician Blaise
Pascal often gets credit for working with these expansions of binomials in the 17th
century, Chinese mathematicians had been working with them almost 400 years
earlier!

Polynomials - Divide Polynomials
Objective: Divide polynomials using long division.
Dividing polynomials is a process very similar to long division of whole numbers.
But before we look at that, we will first want to be able to master dividing a
polynomial by a monomial. The way we do this is very similar to distributing,
but the operation we distribute is the division, dividing each term by the mono-
mial and reducing the resulting expression. This is shown in the following exam-
ples

2x+1 + OurSolution
− 2x 2x2
The previous example illustrates that sometimes we will have fractions in our
solution, as long as they are reduced this will be correct for our solution. Also
4x2
interesting in this problem is the second term divided out completely.
4x2
Remember that this means the reduced answer is 1 not 0.
Long division is required when we divide by more than just a monomial. Long
division with polynomials works very similar to long division with whole numbers.
205An example is given to review the (general) steps that are used with whole num-
bers that we will also use with polynomials
Example 258.

This same process will be used to multiply polynomials. The only difference is we
will replace the word “number” with the word “term”
Dividing Polynomials
1. Divide front terms
2. Multiply this term by the divisor
2063. Change the sign of the terms and combine
4. Bring down the next term
5. Repeat
Step number 3 tends to be the one that students skip, not changing the signs of
the terms would be equivalent to adding instead of subtracting on long division
with whole numbers. Be sure not to miss this step! This process is illustrated in
the following two examples.

In both of the previous example the dividends had the exponents on our variable
counting down, no exponent skipped, third power, second power, first power, zero
power (remember x0 = 1 so there is no variable on zero power). This is very
important in long division, the variables must count down and no exponent can
be skipped. If they don’t count down we must put them in order. If an exponent
is skipped we will have to add a term to the problem, with zero for its coefficient.
This is demonstrated in the following example.

It is important to take a moment to check each problem to verify that the expo-
nents count down and no exponent is skipped. If so we will have to adjust the
problem. Also, this final example illustrates, just as in regular long division,
sometimes we have no remainder in a problem.
World View Note: Paolo Ruffini was an Italian Mathematician of the early
19th century. In 1809 he was the first to describe a process called synthetic divi-
sion which could also be used to divide polynomials.

Factoring - Greatest Common Factor
Objective: Find the greatest common factor of a polynomial and factor
it out of the expression.
The opposite of multiplying polynomials together is factoring polynomials. There
are many benifits of a polynomial being factored. We use factored polynomials to
help us solve equations, learn behaviors of graphs, work with fractions and more.
Because so many concepts in algebra depend on us being able to factor polyno-
mials it is very important to have very strong factoring skills.
In this lesson we will focus on factoring using the greatest common factor or GCF
of a polynomial. When we multiplied polynomials, we multiplied monomials by
polynomials by distributing, solving problems such as 4x2(2x2 3x + 8) = 8x4
− −
12x3 + 32x. In this lesson we will work the same problem backwards. We will
start with 8x2 12x3+32x and try and work backwards to the 4x2(2x 3x+8).
− −
To do this we have to be able to first identify what is the GCF of a polynomial.
We will first introduce this by looking at finding the GCF of several numbers. To
find a GCF of sevearal numbers we are looking for the largest number that can be
divided by each of the numbers. This can often be done with quick mental math
and it is shown in the following example
Example 262.
FindtheGCFof15,24,and27
15 24 27
=5, =6, =9 Eachofthenumberscanbedividedby3
3 3 3
GCF=3 OurSolution
When there are variables in our problem we can first find the GCF of the num-
212bers using mental math, then we take any variables that are in common with each
term, using the lowest exponent. This is shown in the next example
Example 263.
GCFof24x4y2z,18x2y4,and12x3yz5
24 18 12
=4, =3, =2 Eachnumbercanbedividedby6
6 6 6
x2y xandyareinall3,usinglowestexponets
GCF=6x2y OurSolution
To factor out a GCF from a polynomial we first need to identify the GCF of all
the terms, this is the part that goes in front of the parenthesis, then we divide
each term by the GCF, the answer is what is left inside the parenthesis. This is
shown in the following examples
Example 264.
4x2 20x+16 GCFis4,divideeachtermby4

4x2 20x 16
=x2, − = 5x, =4 Thisiswhatisleftinsidetheparenthesis
4 4 − 4
4(x2 5x+4) OurSolution
−
With factoring we can always check our solutions by multiplying (distributing in
this case) out the answer and the solution should be the original equation.
Example 265.
25x4 15x3+20x2 GCFis5x2,divideeachtermbythis

25x4 15x3 20x2

=3x2z, =5x3yz5,− = 4y2 Thisiswhatisleftinparenthesis
xy2 xy2 xy2 −
xy2(3x2z+5x3yz5 4y2) OurSolution
−
World View Note: The first recorded algorithm for finding the greatest
common factor comes from Greek mathematician Euclid around the year 300 BC!
Example 267.
21x3+14x2+7x GCFis7x,divideeachtermbythis
21x3 14x2 7x
=3x2, =2x, =1 Thisiswhatisleftinsidetheparenthesis
7x 7x 7x
7x(3x2+2x+1) OurSolution
It is important to note in the previous example, that when the GCF was 7x and
7x was one of the terms, dividing gave an answer of 1. Students often try to
factor out the 7x and get zero which is incorrect, factoring will never make terms
dissapear. Anything divided by itself is 1, be sure to not forget to put the 1 into
the solution.
Often the second line is not shown in the work of factoring the GCF. We can
simply identify the GCF and put it in front of the parenthesis as shown in the fol-
lowing two examples.
Example 268.
12x5y2 6x4y4+8x3y5 GCFis2x3y2,putthisinfrontofparenthesisanddivide
−
2x3y2(6x2 3xy2+4y3) OurSolution

Example 269.
18a4b3 27a3b3+9a2b3 GCFis9a2b3,divideeachtermbythis
−
9a2b3(2a2 3a+1) OurSolution
−
Again, in the previous problem, when dividing 9a2b3 by itself, the answer is 1, not
zero. Be very careful that each term is accounted for in your final solution.

Factoring - Grouping
Objective: Factor polynomials with four terms using grouping.
The first thing we will always do when factoring is try to factor out a GCF. This
GCF is often a monomial like in the problem 5xy + 10xz the GCF is the mono-
mial 5x, so we would have 5x(y + 2z). However, a GCF does not have to be a
monomial, it could be a binomial. To see this, consider the following two example.
Example 270.
3ax 7bx Bothhavexincommon,factoritout
−
x(3a 7b) OurSolution
−
Now the same problem, but instead of x we have (2a+5b).

(2a+5b)(3a 7b) OurSolution
−
In the same way we factored out a GCF of x we can factor out a GCF which is a
binomial, (2a+5b). This process can be extended to factor problems where there
is no GCF to factor out, or after the GCF is factored out, there is more factoring
that can be done. Here we will have to use another strategy to factor. We will use
a process known as grouping. Grouping is how we will factor if there are four
terms in the problem. Remember, factoring is like multiplying in reverse, so first
we will look at a multiplication problem and then try to reverse the process.
Example 272.
(2a+3)(5b+2) Distribute(2a+3)intosecondparenthesis
5b(2a+3)+2(2a+3) Distributeeachmonomial
10ab+15b+4a+6 OurSolution
The solution has four terms in it. We arrived at the solution by looking at the
two parts, 5b(2a + 3) and 2(2a + 3). When we are factoring by grouping we will
always divide the problem into two parts, the first two terms and the last two
terms. Then we can factor the GCF out of both the left and right sides. When we
do this our hope is what is left in the parenthesis will match on both the left and
right. If they match we can pull this matching GCF out front, putting the rest in
parenthesis and we will be factored. The next example is the same problem
worked backwards, factoring instead of multiplying.
216Example 273.

5b(2a+3) +2(2a+3) (2a+3)isthesame!FactoroutthisGCF
(2a+3)(5b+2) OurSolution
The key for grouping to work is after the GCF is factored out of the left and
right, the two binomials must match exactly. If there is any difference between
the two we either have to do some adjusting or it can’t be factored using the
grouping method. Consider the following example.
Example 274.
6x2+9xy 14x 21y Splitproblemintotwogroups

− −
3x(2x+3y) +7( 2x 3y) Thesignsintheparenthesisdontmatch!
′
− −
when the signs don’t match on both terms we can easily make them match by fac-
toring the opposite of the GCF on the right side. Instead of 7 we will use 7.
−
This will change the signs inside the second parenthesis.
3x(2x+3y) 7(2x+3y) (2x+3y)isthesame!FactoroutthisGCF
−
(2x+3y)(3x 7) OurSolution
−
Often we can recognize early that we need to use the opposite of the GCF when
factoring. If the first term of the first binomial is positive in the problem, we will
also want the first term of the second binomial to be positive. If it is negative
then we will use the opposite of the GCF to be sure they match.
Example 275.

217Sometimes when factoring the GCF out of the left or right side there is no GCF
to factor out. In this case we will use either the GCF of 1 or 1. Often this is all
−
we need to be sure the two binomials match.
Example 276.

− − −
(2x 5)(3x2+1) OurSolution
−
Another problem that may come up with grouping is after factoring out the GCF
on the left and right, the binomials don’t match, more than just the signs are dif-
ferent. In this case we may have to adjust the problem slightly. One way to do
this is to change the order of the terms and try again. To do this we will move
the second term to the end of the problem and see if that helps us use grouping.
Example 278.

−
(2a+3b)(2a 7b2) OurSolution
−
When rearranging terms the problem can still be out of order. Sometimes after
factoring out the GCF the terms are backwards. There are two ways that this can
happen, one with addition, one with subtraction. If it happens with addition, for
218example the binomials are (a + b) and (b + a), we don’t have to do any extra
work. This is because addition is the same in either order (5+3=3+5=8).
Example 279.

−
(y+7)(1 3x) OurSolution
−
However, if the binomial has subtraction, then we need to be a bit more careful.
For example, if the binomials are (a b) and (b a), we will factor out the oppo-
− −
site of the GCF on one part, usually the second. Notice what happens when we
factor out 1.

Generally we won’t show all the above steps, we will simply factor out the oppo-
site of the GCF and switch the order of the subtraction to make it match the
other binomial.

Factoring - Trinomials where a = 1
Objective: Factor trinomials where the coefficient of x2 is one.
Factoring with three terms, or trinomials, is the most important type of factoring
to be able to master. As factoring is multiplication backwards we will start with a
multipication problem and look at how we can reverse the process.
Example 282.
(x+6)(x 4) Distribute(x+6)throughsecondparenthesis
−
x(x+6) 4(x+6) Distribute eachmonomialthroughparenthesis
−
x2+6x 4x 24 Combineliketerms
− −
x2+2x 24 OurSolution
−
You may notice that if you reverse the last three steps the process looks like
grouping. This is because it is grouping! The GCF of the left two terms is x and
the GCF of the second two terms is 4. The way we will factor trinomials is to
−
make them into a polynomial with four terms and then factor by grouping. This
is shown in the following example, the same problem worked backwards
Example 283.
x2+2x 24 Splitmiddleterminto+6x 4x

x2+6x 4x 24 Grouping:GCFonleftisx,onrightis 4
− − −
x(x+6) 4(x+6) (x+6)isthesame,factoroutthisGCF
−
(x+6)(x 4) OurSolution
−
The trick to make these problems work is how we split the middle term. Why did
we pick+6x 4x and not +5x 3x? The reason is because 6x 4x is the only
− − −
combination that works! So how do we know what is the one combination that
works? To find the correct way to split the middle term we will use what is called
the ac method. In the next lesson we will discuss why it is called the ac method.
The way the ac method works is we find a pair of numers that multiply to a cer-
tain number and add to another number. Here we will try to multiply to get the
last term and add to get the coefficient of the middle term. In the previous
221example that would mean we wanted to multiply to 24 and add to + 2. The
−
only numbers that can do this are 6 and 4 (6 4 = 24 and 6 + ( 4) = 2).
− · − − −
This process is shown in the next few examples

Often when factoring we have two variables. These problems solve just like prob-
lems with one variable, using the coefficients to decide how to split the middle
term
Example 287.
a2 9ab+14b2 Wanttomultiplyto14,addto 9
− −
a2 7ab 2ab+14b2 7and 2,splitthemiddleterm
− − − −
a(a 7b) 2b(a 7b) Factorbygrouping
− − −
(a 7b)(a 2b) OurSolution
− −
222As the past few examples illustrate, it is very important to be aware of negatives
as we find the pair of numbers we will use to split the middle term. Consier the
following example, done incorrectly, ignoring negative signs
Warning 288.
x2+5x 6 Wanttomultiplyto6,add5
−
x2+2x+3x 6 2and3,splitthemiddleterm
−
x(x+2)+3(x 2) Factorbygrouping
−
??? Binomialsdonotmatch!
Because we did not use the negative sign with the six to find our pair of numbers,
the binomials did not match and grouping was not able to work at the end. Now
the problem will be done correctly.
Example 289.
x2+5x 6 Wanttomultiplyto 6,addto5
− −
x2+6x x 6 6and 1,splitthemiddleterm
− − −
x(x+6) 1(x+6) Factorbygrouping
−
(x+6)(x 1) OurSolution
−
You may have noticed a shortcut for factoring these problems. Once we identify
the two numbers that are used to split the middle term, these are the two num-
bers in our factors! In the previous example, the numbers used to split the middle
term were 6 and 1, our factors turned out to be (x + 6)(x 1). This pattern
− −
does not always work, so be careful getting in the habit of using it. We can use it
however, when we have no number (technically we have a 1) in front of x2. In all
the problems we have factored in this lesson there is no number in front of x2. If
this is the case then we can use this shortcut. This is shown in the next few
examples.

It is possible to have a problem that does not factor. If there is no combination of
numbers that multiplies and adds to the correct numbers, then we say we cannot
factor the polynomial, or we say the polynomial is prime. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example.

When factoring it is important not to forget about the GCF. If all the terms in a
problem have a common factor we will want to first factor out the GCF before we
factor using any other method.
Example 293.

Again it is important to comment on the shortcut of jumping right to the factors,
this only works if there is no coefficient on x2. In the next lesson we will look at
how this process changes slightly when we have a number in front of x2. Be
careful not to use this shortcut on all factoring problems!

cois Vieta in 1591 in France. He used vowels to represent variables we are solving

Factoring - Trinomials where a 1
(cid:2)
Objective: Factor trinomials using the ac method when the coefficient
of x2 is not one.
When factoring trinomials we used the ac method to split the middle term and
then factor by grouping. The ac method gets it’s name from the general trinomial
equation, ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are the numbers in front of x2,
xandtheconstantattheend respectively.
World View Note: It was French philosopher Rene Descartes who first used let-
ters from the beginning of the alphabet to represent values we know (a, b, c) and
letters from the end to represent letters we don’t know and are solving for (x, y,
z).
The ac method is named ac because we multiply a c to find out what we want to
·
multiply to. In the previous lesson we always multiplied to just c because there
was no number in front of x2. This meant the number was 1 and we were multi-
plying to 1c or just c. Now we will have a number in front of x2 so we will be
looking for numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. Other than this, the pro-
cess will be the same.

When a=1, or no coefficient in front of x2, we were able to use a shortcut, using
the numbers that split the middle term in the factors. The previous example illus-
trates an important point, the shortcut does not work when a 1. We must go
(cid:2)
through all the steps of grouping in order to factor the problem.

As always, when factoring we will first look for a GCF before using any other
method, including the ac method. Factoring out the GCF first also has the added
bonus of making the numbers smaller so the ac method becomes easier.
Example 298.

As was the case with trinomials when a=1, not all trinomials can be factored. If
there is no combinations that multiply and add correctly then we can say the tri-
nomial is prime and cannot be factored.

Factoring - Factoring Special Products
Objective: Identify and factor special products including a difference of
squares, perfect squares, and sum and difference of cubes.
When factoring there are a few special products that, if we can recognize them,
can help us factor polynomials. The first is one we have seen before. When multi-
plying special products we found that a sum and a difference could multiply to a
difference of squares. Here we will use this special product to help us factor
DifferenceofSquares:a2 b2=(a+b)(a b)
− −
If we are subtracting two perfect squares then it will always factor to the sum and
difference of the square roots.

It is important to note, that a sum of squares will never factor. It is always
prime. This can be seen if we try to use the ac method to factor x2+36.

Prime,cannotfactor OurSolution
229It turns out that a sum of squares is always prime.
SumofSquares:a2+b2=Prime
A great example where we see a sum of squares comes from factoring a difference
of 4th powers. Because the square root of a fourth power is a square (√a4 = a2),
we can factor a difference of fourth powers just like we factor a difference of
squares, to a sum and difference of the square roots. This will give us two factors,
one which will be a prime sum of squares, and a second which will be a difference
of squares which we can factor again. This is shown in the following examples.

Another factoring shortcut is the perfect square. We had a shortcut for multi-
plying a perfect square which can be reversed to help us factor a perfect square
PerfectSquare:a2+2ab+b2=(a+b)2
A perfect square can be difficult to recognize at first glance, but if we use the ac
method and get two of the same numbers we know we have a perfect square.
Then we can just factor using the square roots of the first and last terms and the
sign from the middle. This is shown in the following examples.

World View Note: The first known record of work with polynomials comes
from the Chinese around 200 BC. Problems would be written as “three sheafs of a
good crop, two sheafs of a mediocre crop, and one sheaf of a bad crop sold for 29
dou. This would be the polynomial (trinomial) 3x+2y+z=29.
Another factoring shortcut has cubes. With cubes we can either do a sum or a
difference of cubes. Both sum and difference of cubes have very similar factoring
formulas
SumofCubes:a3+b3=(a+b)(a2 ab+b2)
−
DifferenceofCubes:a3 b3=(a b)(a2+ab+b2)
− −
Comparing the formulas you may notice that the only difference is the signs in
between the terms. One way to keep these two formulas straight is to think of
SOAP. S stands for Same sign as the problem. If we have a sum of cubes, we add
first, a difference of cubes we subtract first. O stands for Opposite sign. If we
have a sum, then subtraction is the second sign, a difference would have addition
for the second sign. Finally, AP stands for Always Positive. Both formulas end
with addition. The following examples show factoring with cubes.
Example 307.

(5p 2r)(25p2 10r 4r2) Useformula,useSOAPtofillinsigns
(5p+2r)(25p2 10r+4r2) OurSolution
−
The previous example illustrates an important point. When we fill in the trino-
mial’s first and last terms we square the cube roots 5p and 2r. Often students
forget to square the number in addition to the variable. Notice that when done
correctly, both get cubed.
231Often after factoring a sum or difference of cubes, students want to factor the
second factor, the trinomial further. As a general rule, this factor will always be
prime (unless there is a GCF which should have been factored out before using
cubes rule).
The following table sumarizes all of the shortcuts that we can use to factor special
products

As always, when factoring special products it is important to check for a GCF
first. Only after checking for a GCF should we be using the special products.

Factoring - Factoring Strategy
Objective: Idenfity and use the correct method to factor various poly-
nomials.
With so many different tools used to factor, it is easy to get lost as to which tool
to use when. Here we will attempt to organize all the different factoring types we
have seen. A large part of deciding how to solve a problem is based on how many
terms are in the problem. For all problem types we will always try to factor out
the GCF first.
Factoring Strategy (GCF First!!!!!)
2 terms: sum or difference of squares or cubes:
•
a2 b2=(a+b)(a b)
− −
a2+b2=Prime
a3+b3=(a+b)(a2 ab+b2)
−
a3 b3=(a b)(a2+ab+b2)

3 terms: ac method, watch for perfect square!

We will use the above strategy to factor each of the following examples. Here the
emphasis will be on which strategy to use rather than the steps used in that
method.

toring methods, but decided on which method to use. This is why practice is very
important!

Factoring - Solve by Factoring
Objective: Solve quadratic equation by factoring and using the zero
product rule.
When solving linear equations such as 2x 5 = 21 we can solve for the variable
−
directly by adding 5 and dividing by 2 to get 13. However, when we have x2 (or a
higher power of x) we cannot just isolate the variable as we did with the linear
equations. One method that we can use to solve for the varaible is known as the
zero product rule
ZeroProductRule:If ab=0theneithera=0orb=0
The zero product rule tells us that if two factors are multiplied together and the
answer is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. We can use this to help us
solve factored polynomials as in the following example.
Example 317.
(2x 3)(5x+1)=0 Onefactormustbezero

− −

−

3 1
x= or − OurSolution
2 5
For the zero product rule to work we must have factors to set equal to zero. This
means if the problem is not already factored we will factor it first.

Another important part of the zero product rule is that before we factor, the
equation must equal zero. If it does not, we must move terms around so it does
equal zero. Generally we like the x2 term to be positive.

Most problems with x2 will have two unique solutions. However, it is possible to
have only one solution as the next example illustrates.

As always it will be important to factor out the GCF first if we have one. This
GCF is also a factor and must also be set equal to zero using the zero product
rule. This may give us more than just two solution. The next few examples illus-
trate this.

In the previous example, the GCF did not have a variable in it. When we set this
factor equal to zero we got a false statement. No solutions come from this factor.
Often a student will skip setting the GCF factor equal to zero if there is no vari-
ables in the GCF.
Just as not all polynomials cannot factor, all equations cannot be solved by fac-
toring. If an equation does not factor we will have to solve it using another
method. These other methods are saved for another section.
World View Note: While factoring works great to solve problems with x2,
Tartaglia, in 16th century Italy, developed a method to solve problems with x3.
He kept his method a secret until another mathematician, Cardan, talked him out
of his secret and published the results. To this day the formula is known as
Cardan’s Formula.
A question often asked is if it is possible to get rid of the square on the variable
by taking the square root of both sides. While it is possible, there are a few prop-
erties of square roots that we have not covered yet and thus it is common to
break a rule of roots that we are not aware of at this point. The short reason we
want to avoid this for now is because taking a square root will only give us one of
the two answers. When we talk about roots we will come back to problems like
these and see how we can solve using square roots in a method called completing
the square. For now, never take the square root of both sides!

Rational Expressions - Reduce Rational Expressions
Objective: Reduce rational expressions by dividing out common fac-
tors.
Rational expressions are expressions written as a quotient of polynomials.
Examples of rational expressions include:
x2 x 12 3 a b 3
− − and and − and
x2 9x+20 x 2 b a 2
− − −
As rational expressions are a special type of fraction, it is important to remember
with fractions we cannot have zero in the denominator of a fraction. For this
reason, rational expressions may have one more excluded values, or values that
the variable cannot be or the expression would be undefined.
Example 326.

This means we can use any value for x in the equation except for 0 and −5 . We
3
243can however, evaluate any other value in the expression.
World View Note: The number zero was not widely accepted in mathematical
thought around the world for many years. It was the Mayans of Central America
who first used zero to aid in the use of their base 20 system as a place holder!
Rational expressions are easily evaluated by simply substituting the value for the
variable and using order of operations.

4 OurSolution
Just as we reduced the previous example, often a rational expression can be
reduced, even without knowing the value of the variable. When we reduce we
divide out common factors. We have already seen this with monomials when we
discussed properties of exponents. If the problem only has monomials we can
reduce the coefficients, and subtract exponents on the variables.
Example 328.

244However, if there is more than just one term in either the numerator or denomi-
nator, we can’t divide out common factors unless we first factor the numerator
and denominator.

It is important to remember we cannot reduce terms, only factors. This means if
there are any + or between the parts we want to reduce we cannot. In the pre-

vious example we had the solution x −5 , we cannot divide out the x’s because
x+3
they are terms (separated by + or ) not factors (separated by multiplication).

The process is identical for division with the extra first step of multiplying by the

cess, first divide out common factors, then multiply straight across.

Rational Expressions - Least Common Denominators
Objective: Idenfity the least common denominator and build up
denominators to match this common denominator.
As with fractions, the least common denominator or LCD is very important to
working with rational expressions. The process we use to find the LCD is based
on the process used to find the LCD of intergers.
Example 338.
FindtheLCDof8and6 Considermultiplesofthelargernumber
8,16,24 . 24isthefirstmultipleof8thatisalsodivisibleby6
(cid:9)
24 OurSolution
When finding the LCD of several monomials we first find the LCD of the coeffi-
cients, then use all variables and attach the highest exponent on each variable.
Example 339.
FindtheLCDof4x2y5and6x4y3z6
FirstfindtheLCDofcoefficients4and6
12 12istheLCDof4and6
x4y5z6 Useallvariableswithhighestexponentsoneachvariable
12x4y5z6 OurSolution
The same pattern can be used on polynomials that have more than one term.
However, we must first factor each polynomial so we can identify all the factors to
be used (attaching highest exponent if necessary).
Example 340.
FindtheLCDofx2+2x 3andx2 x 12 Factoreachpolynomial
− − −
(x 1)(x+3)and(x 4)(x+3) LCDusesalluniquefactors
− −
(x 1)(x+3)(x 4) OurSolution
− −
Notice we only used (x+3) once in our LCD. This is because it only appears as a
factor once in either polynomial. The only time we need to repeat a factor or use
an exponent on a factor is if there are exponents when one of the polynomials is
factored
253Example 341.
FindtheLCDofx2 10x+25andx2 14x+45
− −
Factoreachpolynomial
(x 5)2and(x 5)(x 9) LCDusesalluniquefactorswithhighestexponent
− − −
(x 5)2(x 9) OurSolution
− −
The previous example could have also been done with factoring the first polyno-
mial to (x 5)(x 5). Then we would have used (x 5) twice in the LCD
− − −
because it showed up twice in one of the polynomials. However, it is the author’s
suggestion to use the exponents in factored form so as to use the same pattern
(highest exponent) as used with monomials.
Once we know the LCD, our goal will be to build up fractions so they have
matching denominators. In this lesson we will not be adding and subtracting frac-
tions, just building them up to a common denominator. We can build up a frac-
tion’s denominator by multipliplying the numerator and denoinator by any factors
that are not already in the denominator.

254As the above example illustrates, we will multiply out our numerators, but keep
our denominators factored. The reason for this is to add and subtract fractions
we will want to be able to combine like terms in the numerator, then when we
reduce at the end we will want our denominators factored.
Once we know how to find the LCD and how to build up fractions to a desired
denominator we can combine them together by finding a common denominator
and building up those fractions.

Rational Expressions - Add & Subtract
Objective: Add and subtract rational expressions with and without
common denominators.
Adding and subtracting rational expressions is identical to adding and subtracting
with integers. Recall that when adding with a common denominator we add the
numerators and keep the denominator. This is the same process used with
rational expressions. Remember to reduce, if possible, your final answer.

257Subtraction with common denominator follows the same pattern, though the sub-
traction can cause problems if we are not careful with it. To avoid sign errors we
will first distribute the subtraction through the numerator. Then we can treat it
like an addition problem. This process is the same as “add the opposite” we saw
when subtracting with negatives.

World View Note: The Rhind papyrus of Egypt from 1650 BC gives some of
the earliest known symbols for addition and subtraction, a pair of legs walking in
the direction one reads for addition, and a pair of legs walking in the opposite
direction for subtraction..
When we don’t have a common denominator we will have to find the least
common denominator (LCD) and build up each fraction so the denominators
match. The following example shows this process with integers.
Example 348.

The same process can be used for subtraction, we will simply add the first step of
adding the opposite.

If our denominators have more than one term in them we will need to factor first
to find the LCD. Then we build up each denominator using the factors that are
259missing on each fraction.

Rational Expressions - Complex Fractions
Objective: Simplify complex fractions by multiplying each term by the
least common denominator.
Complex fractions have fractions in either the numerator, or denominator, or usu-
ally both. These fractions can be simplified in one of two ways. This will be illus-
trated first with integers, then we will consider how the process can be expanded
to include expressions with variables.
The first method uses order of operations to simplify the numerator and denomi-
nator first, then divide the two resulting fractions by multiplying by the recip-
rocal.

The process above works just fine to simplify, but between getting common
denominators, taking reciprocals, and reducing, it can be a very involved process.
Generally we prefer a different method, to multiply the numerator and denomi-
nator of the large fraction (in effect each term in the complex fraction) by the
least common denominator (LCD). This will allow us to reduce and clear the
small fractions. We will simplify the same problem using this second method.

Clearly the second method is a much cleaner and faster method to arrive at our
solution. It is the method we will use when simplifying with variables as well. We
will first find the LCD of the small fractions, and multiply each term by this LCD
so we can clear the small fractions and simplify.

World View Note: Sophie Germain is one of the most famous women in mathe-
matics, many primes, which are important to finding an LCD, carry her name.
Germain primes are prime numbers where one more than double the prime
number is also prime, for example 3 is prime and so is 2 3 + 1 = 7 prime. The
·
largest known Germain prime (at the time of printing) is 183027 2265440 1 which
· −
has 79911 digits!
Some problems may require us to FOIL as we simplify. To avoid sign errors, if
there is a binomial in the numerator, we will first distribute the negative through
the numerator.

If there are negative exponents in an expression we will have to first convert these
negative exponents into fractions. Remember, the exponent is only on the factor
it is attached to, not the whole term.

Rational Expressions - Proportions
Objective: Solve proportions using the cross product and use propor-
tions to solve application problems
When two fractions are equal, they are called a proportion. This definition can be
generalized to two equal rational expressions. Proportions have an important
property called the cross-product.
a c
CrossProduct:If = thenad=bc
b d
The cross product tells us we can multiply diagonally to get an equation with no
fractions that we can solve.

World View Note: The first clear definition of a proportion and the notation
for a proportion came from the German Leibniz who wrote, “I write dy:x=dt:a;
for dy is to x as dt is to a, is indeed the same as, dy divided by x is equal to dt
divided by a. From this equation follow then all the rules of proportion.”
If the proportion has more than one term in either numerator or denominator, we
will have to distribute while calculating the cross product.

As we solve proportions we may end up with a quadratic that we will have to
solve. We can solve this quadratic in the same way we solved quadratics in the
past, either factoring, completing the square or the quadratic formula. As with
solving quadratics before, we will generally end up with two solutions.

Proportions are very useful in how they can be used in many different types of
applications. We can use them to compare different quantities and make conclu-
sions about how quantities are related. As we set up these problems it is impor-
tant to remember to stay organized, if we are comparing dogs and cats, and the
number of dogs is in the numerator of the first fraction, then the numerator of the
second fraction should also refer to the dogs. This consistency of the numerator
and denominator is essential in setting up our proportions.

Rational Expressions - Solving Rational Equations
Objective: Solve rational equations by identifying and multiplying by
the least common denominator.
When solving equations that are made up of rational expressions we will solve
them using the same strategy we used to solve linear equations with fractions.
When we solved problems like the next example, we cleared the fraction by multi-
plying by the least common denominator (LCD)

We will use the same process to solve rational equations, the only difference is our
274LCD will be more involved. We will also have to be aware of domain issues. If our
LCD equals zero, the solution is undefined. We will always check our solutions in
the LCD as we may have to remove a solution from our solution set.

If we are subtracting a fraction in the problem, it may be easier to avoid a future
sign error by first distributing the negative through the numerator.

Rational Expressions - Dimensional Analysis
Objective: Use dimensional analysis to preform single unit, dual unit,
square unit, and cubed unit conversions.
One application of rational expressions deals with converting units. When we con-
vert units of measure we can do so by multiplying several fractions together in a
process known as dimensional analysis. The trick will be to decide what fractions
to multiply. When multiplying, if we multiply by 1, the value of the expression
does not change. One written as a fraction can look like many different things as
long as the numerator and denominator are identical in value. Notice the numer-
ator and denominator are not identical in appearance, but rather identical in
value. Below are several fractions, each equal to one where numerator and denom-
inator are identical in value.

The last few fractions that include units are called conversion factors. We can
make a conversion factor out of any two measurements that represent the same
distance. For example, 1 mile = 5280 feet. We could then make a conversion
1mi
factor because both values are the same, the fraction is still equal to one.
5280ft
5280ft
Similarly we could make a conversion factor . The trick for conversions will
1mi
279be to use the correct fractions.
The idea behind dimensional analysis is we will multiply by a fraction in such a
way that the units we don’t want will divide out of the problem. We found out
when multiplying rational expressions that if a variable appears in the numerator
and denominator we can divide it out of the expression. It is the same with units.
Consider the following conversion.

In the previous example, we had to use the conversion factor so the miles
1mi
1mi
would divide out. If we had used we would not have been able to divide out
5280ft
the miles. This is why when doing dimensional analysis it is very important to
use units in the set-up of the problem, so we know how to correctly set up the
conversion factor.

If the units are two-dimensional (such as square inches - in2) or three-dimensional
(such as cubic feet - ft3) we will need to put the same exponent on the conversion
factor. So if we are converting square inches (in2) to square ft (ft2), the conversion

factor would be squared, . Similarly if the units are cubed, we will cube

the convesion factor.

282To focus on the process of conversions, a conversion sheet has been included at
the end of this lesson which includes several conversion factors for length, volume,
mass and time in both English and Metric units.
The process of dimensional analysis can be used to convert other types of units as
well. If we can identify relationships that represent the same value we can make
them into a conversion factor.

Radicals - Square Roots
Objective: Simplify expressions with square roots.
Square roots are the most common type of radical used. A square root “un-
squares” a number. For example, because 52=25 we say the square root of 25 is 5.
The square root of 25 is written as √25.
World View Note: The radical sign, when first used was an R with a line
through the tail, similar to our perscription symbol today. The R came from the
latin, “radix”, which can be translated as “source” or “foundation”. It wasn’t until
the 1500s that our current symbol was first used in Germany (but even then it
was just a check mark with no bar over the numbers!
The following example gives several square roots:
Example 377.
√1=1 √121=11
√4=2 √625=25
√9=3 √ 81=Undefined
−
The final example, √ 81 is currently undefined as negatives have no square root.
−
This is because if we square a positive or a negative, the answer will be positive.
Thus we can only take square roots of positive numbers. In another lesson we will
define a method we can use to work with and evaluate negative square roots, but
for now we will simply say they are undefined.
Not all numbers have a nice even square root. For example, if we found √8 on
our calculator, the answer would be 2.828427124746190097603377448419... and
even this number is a rounded approximation of the square root. To be as accu-
rate as possible, we will never use the calculator to find decimal approximations of
square roots. Instead we will express roots in simplest radical form. We will do
this using a property known as the product rule of radicals
ProductRuleofSquareRoots:√a b=√a √b
· ·
We can use the product rule to simplify an expression such as √36 5 by spliting
·
it into two roots, √36 √5, and simplifying the first root, 6√5. The trick in this
·
288process is being able to translate a problem like √180 into √36 5. There are sev-
·
eral ways this can be done. The most common and, with a bit of practice, the
fastest method, is to find perfect squares that divide evenly into the radicand, or
number under the radical. This is shown in the next example.

If there is a coefficient in front of the radical to begin with, the problem merely
becomes a big multiplication problem.

As we simplify radicals using this method it is important to be sure our final
answer can be simplified no more.

2896√2 OurSolution.
The previous example could have been done in fewer steps if we had noticed that
72=36 2, but often the time it takes to discover the larger perfect square is more
·
than it would take to simplify in several steps.
Variables often are part of the radicand as well. When taking the square roots of
variables, we can divide the exponent by 2. For example, √x8 = x4, because we
divide the exponent of 8 by 2. This follows from the power of a power rule of
expoennts, (x4)2=x8. When squaring, we multiply the exponent by two, so when
taking a square root we divide the exponent by 2. This is shown in the following
example.

We can’t always evenly divide the exponent on a variable by 2. Sometimes we
have a remainder. If there is a remainder, this means the remainder is left inside
the radical, and the whole number part is how many are outside the radical. This
is shown in the following example.

Radicals - Higher Roots
Objective: Simplify radicals with an index greater than two.
While square roots are the most common type of radical we work with, we can
take higher roots of numbers as well: cube roots, fourth roots, fifth roots, etc. Fol-
lowing is a definition of radicals.
m√a=bif bm=a
The small letter m inside the radical is called the index. It tells us which root we
are taking, or which power we are “un-doing”. For square roots the index is 2. As
this is the most common root, the two is not usually written.
World View Note: The word for root comes from the French mathematician
Franciscus Vieta in the late 16th century.
The following example includes several higher roots.
Example 383.
3√125=5 3√ 64= 4
− −
4√81=3 7√ 128= 2
− −
5√32=2 4√ 16=undefined
−
We must be careful of a few things as we work with higher roots. First its impor-
tant not to forget to check the index on the root. √81 = 9 but 4√81 = 3. This is
because 92 = 81 and 34 = 81. Another thing to watch out for is negatives under
roots. We can take an odd root of a negative number, because a negative number
raised to an odd power is still negative. However, we cannot take an even root of
a negative number, this we will say is undefined. In a later section we will discuss
how to work with roots of negative, but for now we will simply say they are unde-
fined.
We can simplify higher roots in much the same way we simplified square roots,
using the product property of radicals.
ProductPropertyofRadicals:m√ab=m√a m√b
·
Often we are not as familiar with higher powers as we are with squares. It is
important to remember what index we are working with as we try and work our
way to the solution.

together.

We can also take higher roots of variables. As we do, we will divide the exponent
on the variable by the index. Any whole answer is how many of that varible will
come out of the square root. Any remainder is how many are left behind inside
the square root. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 386.

In the previous example, for the x, we divided 25 = 5R0, so x5 came out, no x’s
5
remain inside. For the y, we divided 17 = 3R2, so y3 came out, and y2 remains
5
inside. For the z, when we divided 3 = 0R3, all three or z3 remained inside. The

following example includes integers in our problem.

Radicals - Adding Radicals
Objective: Add like radicals by first simplifying each radical.
Adding and subtracting radicals is very similar to adding and subtracting with
variables. Consider the following example.

Notice that when we combined the terms with √11 it was just like combining
terms with x. When adding and subtracting with radicals we can combine like
radicals just as like terms. We add and subtract the coefficients in front of the
295radical, and the radical stays the same. This is shown in the following example.
Example 389.

We cannot simplify this expression any more as the radicals do not match. Often
problems we solve have no like radicals, however, if we simplify the radicals first
we may find we do in fact have like radicals.

Radicals - Multiply and Divide Radicals
Objective: Multiply and divide radicals using the product and quotient
rules of radicals.
Multiplying radicals is very simple if the index on all the radicals match. The
prodcut rule of radicals which we have already been using can be generalized as
follows:
ProductRuleofRadicals:a m√b c m√d=ac m√bd
·
Another way of stating this rule is we are allowed to multiply the factors outside
the radical and we are allowed to multiply the factors inside the radicals, as long
as the index matches. This is shown in the following example.

As we are multiplying we always look at our final solution to check if all the radi-
cals are simplified and all like radicals or like terms have been combined.
Division with radicals is very similar to multiplication, if we think about division
as reducing fractions, we can reduce the coefficients outside the radicals and
reduce the values inside the radicals to get our final solution.

There is one catch to dividing with radicals, it is considered bad practice to have
a radical in the denominator of our final answer. If there is a radical in the
denominator we will rationalize it, or clear out any radicals in the denominator.
299We do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same thing.
The problems we will consider here will all have a monomial in the denominator.
The way we clear a monomial radical in the denominator is to focus on the index.
The index tells us how many of each factor we will need to clear the radical. For
example, if the index is 4, we will need 4 of each factor to clear the radical. This
is shown in the following examples.

and we would have needed to reduce our soultion at the end. This is why re-
writing the radical as 3√52 and multiplying by just 3√5 was the better way to sim-
plify.
We will also always want to reduce our fractions (inside and out of the radical)
before we rationalize.

Radicals - Rationalize Denominators
Objective: Rationalize the denominators of radical expressions.
It is considered bad practice to have a radical in the denominator of a fraction.
When this happens we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same
thing in order to clear the radical. In the lesson on dividing radicals we talked
about how this was done with monomials. Here we will look at how this is done
with binomials.
If the binomial is in the numerator the process to rationalize the denominator is
essentially the same as with monomials. The only difference is we will have to dis-
tribute in the numerator.

It is important to remember that when reducing the fraction we cannot reduce
with just the 3 and 12 or just the 9 and 12. When we have addition or subtrac-
tion in the numerator or denominator we must divide all terms by the same
number.
The problem can often be made easier if we first simplify any radicals in the
problem.

As we are rationalizing it will always be important to constantly check our
problem to see if it can be simplified more. We ask ourselves, can the fraction be
reduced? Can the radicals be simplified? These steps may happen several times
on our way to the solution.
If the binomial occurs in the denominator we will have to use a different strategy
2
to clear the radical. Consider , if we were to multiply the denominator by
√3 5
√3 we would have to distribute it− and we would end up with 3 5√3. We have
−
not cleared the radical, only moved it to another part of the denominator. So our
current method will not work. Instead we will use what is called a conjugate. A
conjugate is made up of the same terms, with the opposite sign in the middle.
So for our example with √3 5 in the denominator, the conjugate would be √3+
−
5. The advantage of a conjugate is when we multiply them together we have
(√3 5)(√3 + 5), which is a sum and a difference. We know when we multiply
−
these we get a difference of squares. Squaring √3 and 5, with subtraction in the
middle gives the product 3 25= 22. Our answer when multiplying conjugates
− −
will no longer have a square root. This is exactly what we want.

Radicals - Rational Exponents
Objective: Convert between radical notation and exponential notation
and simplify expressions with rational exponents using the properties
of exponents.
When we simplify radicals with exponents, we divide the exponent by the index.
Another way to write division is with a fraction bar. This idea is how we will
define rational exponents.
n
DefinitionofRationalExponents:am =(m√a)n
The denominator of a rational exponent becomes the index on our radical, like-
wise the index on the radical becomes the denominator of the exponent. We can
use this property to change any radical expression into an exponential expression.
Example 410.

1 3 1 2
=a−7 =(xy)−3 Negativeexponentsfromreciprocals
(7√a)3 (3√xy)2
We can also change any rational exponent into a radical expression by using the
denominator as the index.
Example 411.

World View Note: Nicole Oresme, a Mathematician born in Normandy was the
1
first to use rational exponents. He used the notation 1 9p to represent 93. How-
3•
ever his notation went largely unnoticed.
The ability to change between exponential expressions and radical expressions
allows us to evaluate problems we had no means of evaluating before by changing
to a radical.

The largest advantage of being able to change a radical expression into an expo-
nential expression is we are now allowed to use all our exponent properties to sim-
plify. The following table reviews all of our exponent properties.

When adding and subtracting with fractions we need to be sure to have a
common denominator. When multiplying we only need to multiply the numera-
tors together and denominators together. The following examples show several
different problems, using different properties to simplify the rational exponents.

It is important to remember that as we simplify with rational exponents we are
using the exact same properties we used when simplifying integer exponents. The
only difference is we need to follow our rules for fractions as well. It may be worth
reviewing your notes on exponent properties to be sure your comfortable with
using the properties.

Radicals - Radicals of Mixed Index
Objective: Reduce the index on a radical and multiply or divide radi-
cals of different index.
Knowing that a radical has the same properties as exponents (written as a ratio)
allows us to manipulate radicals in new ways. One thing we are allowed to do is
reduce, not just the radicand, but the index as well. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example.

What we have done is reduced our index by dividing the index and all the expo-
nents by the same number (2 in the previous example). If we notice a common
factor in the index and all the exponnets on every factor we can reduce by
dividing by that common factor. This is shown in the next example
Example 418.
2√4 a6b9c15 Indexandallexponentsaredivisibleby3
8√a2b3c5
OurSolution
We can use the same process when there are coefficients in the problem. We will
first write the coefficient as an exponential expression so we can divide the
exponet by the common factor as well.
Example 419.

We can use a very similar idea to also multiply radicals where the index does not
match. First we will consider an example using rational exponents, then identify
the pattern we can use.

To combine the radicals we need a common index (just like the common denomi-
nator). We will get a common index by multiplying each index and exponent by
an integer that will allow us to build up to that desired index. This process is
shown in the next example.
Example 421.
4√a2b3 6√a2b Commonindexis12.
Multiplyfirstindexandexponentsby3,secondby2
1√2 a6b9a4b2 Addexponents
1√2 a10b11 OurSolution
Often after combining radicals of mixed index we will need to simplify the
resulting radical.

Just as with reducing the index, we will rewrite coefficients as exponential expres-
sions. This will also allow us to use exponent properties to simplify.

through the entire problem.

World View Note: Originally the radical was just a check mark with the rest of
the radical expression in parenthesis. In 1637 Rene Descartes was the first to put
a line over the entire radical expression.
The same process is used for dividing mixed index as with multiplying mixed
index. The only difference is our final answer cannot have a radical over the
denominator.

Radicals - Complex Numbers
Objective: Add, subtract, multiply, rationalize, and simplify expres-
sions using complex numbers.
World View Note: When mathematics was first used, the primary purpose was
for counting. Thus they did not originally use negatives, zero, fractions or irra-
tional numbers. However, the ancient Egyptians quickly developed the need for “a
part” and so they made up a new type of number, the ratio or fraction. The
Ancient Greeks did not believe in irrational numbers (people were killed for
believing otherwise). The Mayans of Central America later made up the number
zero when they found use for it as a placeholder. Ancient Chinese Mathematicians
made up negative numbers when they found use for them.
In mathematics, when the current number system does not provide the tools to
solve the problems the culture is working with, we tend to make up new ways for
dealing with the problem that can solve the problem. Throughout history this has
been the case with the need for a number that is nothing (0), smaller than zero
(negatives), between integers (fractions), and between fractions (irrational num-
bers). This is also the case for the square roots of negative numbers. To work
with the square root of negative numbers mathematicians have defined what are
called imaginary and complex numbers.
DefinitionofImaginaryNumbers:i2= 1 (thusi=√ 1)
− −
Examples of imaginary numbers include 3i, 6i, 3i and 3i√5. A complex
− 5
number is one that contains both a real and imaginary part, such as 2+5i.
With this definition, the square root of a negative number is no longer undefined.
We now are allowed to do basic operations with the square root of negatives.
First we will consider exponents on imaginary numbers. We will do this by
manipulating our definition of i2= 1. If we multiply both sides of the definition
−
by i, the equation becomes i3 = i. Then if we multiply both sides of the equa-
−
tion again by i, the equation becomes i4 = i2 = ( 1) = 1, or simply i4 = 1.
− − −
Multiplying again by i gives i5=i. One more time gives i6=i2= 1. And if this
−
pattern continues we see a cycle forming, the exponents on i change we cycle
through simplified answers of i, 1, i, 1. As there are 4 different possible
− −
answers in this cycle, if we divide the exponent by 4 and consider the remainder,
we can simplify any exponent on i by learning just the following four values:

When performing operations (add, subtract, multilpy, divide) we can handle i just
like we handle any other variable. This means when adding and subtracting com-
plex numbers we simply add or combine like terms.
Example 428.

6 2i OurSolution
−
It is important to notice what operation we are doing. Students often see the
parenthesis and think that means FOIL. We only use FOIL to multiply. This
problem is an addition problem so we simply add the terms, or combine like
terms.
For subtraction problems the idea is the same, we need to remember to first dis-
tribute the negative onto all the terms in the parentheses.

320Dividing with complex numbers also has one thing we need to be careful of. If i is
√ 1, and it is in the denominator of a fraction, then we have a radical in the
−
denominator! This means we will want to rationalize our denominator so there
are no i’s. This is done the same way we rationalized denominators with square
roots.

321Using i we can simplify radicals with negatives under the root. We will use the
product rule and simplify the negative as a factor of negative one. This is shown

Quadratics - Solving with Radicals
Objective: Solve equations with radicals and check for extraneous solu-
tions.
Here we look at equations that have roots in the problem. As you might expect,
to clear a root we can raise both sides to an exponent. So to clear a square root
we can rise both sides to the second power. To clear a cubed root we can raise
both sides to a third power. There is one catch to solving a problem with roots in
it, sometimes we end up with solutions that do not actually work in the equation.
This will only happen if the index on the root is even, and it will not happen all
the time. So for these problems it will be required that we check our answer in
the original problem. If a value does not work it is called an extraneous solution
and not included in the final solution.
When solving a radical problem with an even index: check answers!

The above example illustrates that as we solve we could end up with an x2 term
or a quadratic. In this case we remember to set the equation to zero and solve by
factoring. We will have to check both solutions if the index in the problem was
even. Sometimes both values work, sometimes only one, and sometimes neither
works.
World View Note: The babylonians were the first known culture to solve
quadratics in radicals - as early as 2000 BC!
If there is more than one square root in a problem we will clear the roots one at a
time. This means we must first isolate one of them before we square both sides.

When there is more than one square root in the problem, after isolating one root
and squaring both sides we may still have a root remaining in the problem. In
this case we will again isolate the term with the second root and square both
sides. When isolating, we will isolate the term with the square root. This means
the square root can be multiplied by a number after isolating.

Quadratics - Solving with Exponents
Objective: Solve equations with exponents using the odd root property
and the even root property.
Another type of equation we can solve is one with exponents. As you might
expect we can clear exponents by using roots. This is done with very few unex-
pected results when the exponent is odd. We solve these problems very straight
forward using the odd root property
an=b,thena=n√bwhennisodd
OddRootProperty:if
Example 449.
x5=32 Useoddrootproperty
5√x5=5√32
Simplifyroots
x=2 OurSolution
However, when the exponent is even we will have two results from taking an even
root of both sides. One will be positive and one will be negative. This is because
both 32=9 and ( 3)2=9. so when solving x2=9 we will have two solutions, one
−
positive and one negative: x=3and 3

World View Note: In 1545, French Mathematicain Gerolamo Cardano pub-

take a quantity to the fourth power because there are only three dimensions!

When our exponents are a fraction we will need to first convert the fractional
m
exponent into a radical expression to solve. Recall that an = (n√a)m . Once we
have done this we can clear the exponent using either the even ( ) or odd root
±
property. Then we can clear the radical by raising both sides to an exponent
(remember to check answers if the index is even).

With rational exponents it is very helpful to convert to radical form to be able to
see if we need a because we used the even root property, or to see if we need
±
to check our answer because there was an even root in the problem. When
checking we will usually want to check in the radical form as it will be easier to
evaluate.

Quadratics - Complete the Square
Objective: Solve quadratic equations by completing the square.
When solving quadratic equations in the past we have used factoring to solve for
our variable. This is exactly what is done in the next example.

However, the problem with factoring is all equations cannot be factored. Consider
the following equation: x2 2x 7=0. The equation cannot be factored, however
− −
there are two solutions to this equation, 1 + 2√2 and 1 2√2. To find these two
−
solutions we will use a method known as completing the square. When completing
the square we will change the quadratic into a perfect square which can easily be
solved with the square root property. The next example reviews the square root
property.

337To complete the square, or make our problem into the form of the previous
example, we will be searching for the third term in a trinomial. If a quadratic is
of the form x2 + bx + c, and a perfect square, the third term, c, can be easily
2
found by the formula 1 b . This is shown in the following examples, where we
2 ·
find the number that c(cid:16)omple(cid:17)tes the square and then factor the perfect square.

World View Note: The Chinese in 200 BC were the first known culture group
to use a method similar to completing the square, but their method was only used
to calculate positive roots.
The advantage of this method is it can be used to solve any quadratic equation.
The following examples show how completing the square can give us rational solu-
tions, irrational solutions, and even complex solutions.

As several of the examples have shown, when solving by completing the square we
will often need to use fractions and be comfortable finding common denominators
and adding fractions together. Once we get comfortable solving by completing the
square and using the five steps, any quadratic equation can be easily solved.

This solution is a very important one to us. As we solved a general equation by
completing the square, we can use this formula to solve any quadratic equation.
Once we identify what a, b, and c are in the quadratic, we can substitute those

values into x = ± and we will get our two solutions. This formula is

World View Note: Indian mathematician Brahmagupta gave the first explicit
formula for solving quadratics in 628. However, at that time mathematics was not
done with variables and symbols, so the formula he gave was, “To the absolute
number multiplied by four times the square, add the square of the middle term;
the square root of the same, less the middle term, being divided by twice the
square is the value.” This would translate to

We have covered three different methods to use to solve a quadratic: factoring,
complete the square, and the quadratic formula. It is important to be familiar
with all three as each has its advantage to solving quadratics. The following table

Quadratics - Build Quadratics From Roots
Objective: Find a quadratic equation that has given roots using reverse
factoring and reverse completing the square.
Up to this point we have found the solutions to quadratics by a method such as
factoring or completing the square. Here we will take our solutions and work
backwards to find what quadratic goes with the solutions.
We will start with rational solutions. If we have rational solutions we can use fac-
toring in reverse, we will set each solution equal to x and then make the equation
equal to zero by adding or subtracting. Once we have done this our expressions
will become the factors of the quadratic.

If the solutions have radicals (or complex numbers) then we cannot use reverse
factoring. In these cases we will use reverse completing the square. When there
are radicals the solutions will always come in pairs, one with a plus, one with a
minus, that can be combined into “one” solution using . We will then set this
±
solution equal to x and square both sides. This will clear the radical from our
problem.

before factoring, quadratics were solved geometrically by the Greeks as early as

geometrically!
If the solution is a fraction we will clear it just as before by multiplying by the
denominator.

Quadratics - Quadratic in Form
Objective: Solve equations that are quadratic in form by substitution
to create a quadratic equation.
We have seen three different ways to solve quadratics: factoring, completing the
square, and the quadratic formula. A quadratic is any equation of the form 0 =
ax2 + bx + c, however, we can use the skills learned to solve quadratics to solve
problems with higher (or sometimes lower) powers if the equation is in what is
called quadratic form.
QuadraticForm:0=axm+bxn+cwherem=2n
An equation is in quadratic form if one of the exponents on a variable is double
the exponent on the same variable somewhere else in the equation. If this is the
case we can create a new variable, set it equal to the variable with smallest expo-
nent. When we substitute this into the equation we will have a quadratic equa-
tion we can solve.
World View Note: Arab mathematicians around the year 1000 were the first to
use this method!

Quadratics - Rectangles
Objective: Solve applications of quadratic equations using rectangles.
An application of solving quadratic equations comes from the formula for the area
of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the width
by the length. To solve problems with rectangles we will first draw a picture to
represent the problem and use the picture to set up our equation.
Example 484.
The length of a rectangle is 3 more than the width. If the area is 40 square
inches, what are the dimensions?

involved. When we compare two rectangles, we may have to get a bit more cre-
ative.

From one rectangle we can find two equations. Perimeter is found by adding all
the sides of a polygon together. A rectangle has two widths and two lengths, both
the same size. So we can use the equation P = 2l + 2w (twice the length plus
twice the width).

strate that their civilization had worked extensivly in geometry creating religious
alters of various shapes including rectangles.
Another type of rectangle problem is what we will call a “frame problem”. The
idea behind a frame problem is that a rectangle, such as a photograph, is centered
inside another rectangle, such as a frame. In these cases it will be important to
rememember that the frame extends on all sides of the rectangle. This is shown in
the following example.
Example 488.
An 8 in by 12 in picture has a frame of uniform width around it. The area of the
frame is equal to the area of the picture. What is the width of the frame?

For each of the frame problems above we could have also completed the square or
use the quadratic formula to solve the trinomials. Remember that completing the
square or the quadratic formula always will work when solving, however, factoring
only works if we can factor the trinomial.

Quadratics - Teamwork
Objective: Solve teamwork problems by creating a rational equation to
model the problem.
If it takes one person 4 hours to paint a room and another person 12 hours to
paint the same room, working together they could paint the room even quicker, it
turns out they would paint the room in 3 hours together. This can be reasoned by
1
the following logic, if the first person paints the room in 4 hours, she paints of
4
the room each hour. If the second person takes 12 hours to paint the room, he
1 1 1
paints of the room each hour. So together, each hour they paint + of the
12 4 12
3 1 4 1
room. Using a common denominator of 12 gives: + = = . This means
12 12 12 3
1 1
each hour, working together they complete of the room. If is completed each
3 3
hour, it follows that it will take 3 hours to complete the entire room.
This pattern is used to solve teamwork problems. If the first person does a job in
A, a second person does a job in B, and together they can do a job in T (total).
We can use the team work equation.

Often these problems will involve fractions. Rather than thinking of the first frac-

tion as , it may be better to think of it as the reciprocal of A’s time.

World View Note: When the Egyptians, who were the first to work with frac-
tions, wrote fractions, they were all unit fractions (numerator of one). They only
used these type of fractions for about 2000 years! Some believe that this cumber-
some style of using fractions was used for so long out of tradition, others believe
the Egyptians had a way of thinking about and working with fractions that has
been completely lost in history.

In the previous example, when solving, one of the possible times ended up nega-
tive. We can’t have a negative amount of time to build a shed, so this possibility
is ignored for this problem. Also, as we were solving, we had to factor x2 34x+

120. This may have been difficult to factor. We could have also chosen to com-
plete the square or use the quadratic formula to find our solutions.
It is important that units match as we solve problems. This means we may have
to convert minutes into hours to match the other units given in the problem.

Very similar to a teamwork problem is when the two involved parts are working
against each other. A common example of this is a sink that is filled by a pipe
and emptied by a drain. If they are working against eachother we need to make
one of the values negative to show they oppose eachother. This is shown in the
next example..
Example 494.
A sink can be filled by a pipe in 5 minutes but it takes 7 minutes to drain a full
sink. If both the pipe and the drain are open, how long will it take to fill the
sink?

Quadratics - Simultaneous Products
Objective: Solve simultaneous product equations using substitution to
create a rational equation.
When solving a system of equations where the variables are multiplied together
we can use the same idea of substitution that we used with linear equations.
When we do so we may end up with a quadratic equation to solve. When we used
substitution we solved for a variable and substitute this expression into the other
equation. If we have two products we will choose a variable to solve for first and
divide both sides of the equations by that variable or the factor containing the
variable. This will create a situation where substitution can easily be done.

370These simultaneous product equations will also solve by the exact same pattern.
We pick a variable to solve for, divide each side by that variable, or factor con-
taining the variable. This will allow us to use substitution to create a rational
expression we can use to solve. Quite often these problems will have two solu-
tions.

Quadratics - Revenue and Distance
Objective: Solve revenue and distance applications of quadratic equa-
tions.
A common application of quadratics comes from revenue and distance problems.
Both are set up almost identical to each other so they are both included together.
Once they are set up, we will solve them in exactly the same way we solved the
simultaneous product equations.
Revenue problems are problems where a person buys a certain number of items
for a certain price per item. If we multiply the number of items by the price per
item we will get the total paid. To help us organize our information we will use
the following table for revenue problems
Number Price Total
First
Second
The price column will be used for the individual prices, the total column is used
for the total paid, which is calculated by multiplying the number by the price.
Once we have the table filled out we will have our equations which we can solve.
This is shown in the following examples.
Example 497.
A man buys several fish for S56. After three fish die, he decides to sell the rest at
a profit of S5 per fish. His total profit was S4. How many fish did he buy to

The above examples were solved by the quadratic formula and completing the
square. For either of these we could have used either method or even factoring.
Remember we have several options for solving quadratics. Use the one that seems
easiest for the problem.
Distance problems work with the same ideas that the revenue problems work.
The only difference is the variables are r and t (for rate and time), instead of
n and p (for number and price). We already know that distance is calculated by
multiplying rate by time. So for our distance problems our table becomes the fol-
lowing:
rate time distance

Using this table and the exact same patterns as the revenue problems is shown in
the following example.
Example 499.

construction he had to drive 10 mph slower which resulted in the return trip
taking 2 hours longer. How fast did he drive on the way to the conference?

World View Note: The world’s fastest man (at the time of printing) is
Jamaican Usain Bolt who set the record of running 100 m in 9.58 seconds on
August 16, 2009 in Berlin. That is a speed of over 23 miles per hour!
Another type of simultaneous product distance problem is where a boat is trav-
eling in a river with the current or against the current (or an airplane flying with
the wind or against the wind). If a boat is traveling downstream, the current will
push it or increase the rate by the speed of the current. If a boat is traveling
376upstream, the current will pull against it or decrease the rate by the speed of the
current. This is demonstrated in the following example.
Example 500.
A man rows down stream for 30 miles then turns around and returns to his orig-
inal location, the total trip took 8 hours. If the current flows at 2 miles per hour,
how fast would the man row in still water?

higher range. A driver plans to test a car on an available speedway by driving

Quadratics - Graphs of Quadratics
Objective: Graph quadratic equations using the vertex, x-intercepts,
and y-intercept.
Just as we drew pictures of the solutions for lines or linear equations, we can draw
a picture of solution to quadratics as well. One way we can do that is to make a
table of values.

Connect the dots with a smooth
curve.
Our Solution
When we have x2 in our equations, the graph will no longer be a straight line.
Quadratics have a graph that looks like a U shape that is called a parabola.
World View Note: The first major female mathematician was Hypatia of Egypt
who was born around 370 AD. She studied conic sections. The parabola is one
type of conic section.
380The above method to graph a parabola works for any equation, however, it can be
very tedious to find all the correct points to get the correct bend and shape. For
this reason we identify several key points on a graph and in the equation to help
us graph parabolas more efficiently. These key points are described below.
Point A: y-intercept: Where the graph
crosses the vertical y-axis.
B C Points B and C: x-intercepts: Where
the graph crosses the horizontal x-axis
Point D: Vertex: The point where the
A
graph curves and changes directions.
D
We will use the following method to find each of the points on our parabola.
To graph the equation y=ax2+bx+c,findthefollowingpoints
1. y-intercept: Found by making x=0,this simplifies down to y=c
2. x-intercepts: Found by making y=0, this means solving 0=ax2+bx+c
b
3. Vertex: Let x= − to find x. Then plug this value into the equation to find
2a
y.
After finding these points we can connect the dots with a smooth curve to find
our graph!

with a smooth curve in a U shape to
get our parabola.
Our Solution
If the a in y =ax2+bx+c is a negative value, the parabola will end up being an
upside-down U. The process to graph it is identical, we just need to be very
careful of how our signs operate. Remember, if a is negative, then ax2 will also be
negative because we only square the x, not the a.

Our Solution
382It is important to remember the graph of all quadratics is a parabola with the
same U shape (they could be upside-down). If you plot your points and we cannot
connect them in the correct U shape then one of your points must be wrong. Go
back and check your work to be sure they are correct!
Just as all quadratics (equation with y = x2) all have the same U-shape to them
and all linear equations (equations such as y = x) have the same line shape when
graphed, different equations have different shapes to them. Below are some
common equations (some we have yet to cover!) with their graph shape drawn.

Functions - Function Notation
Objective: Idenfity functions and use correct notation to evaluate func-
tions at numerical and variable values.
There are many different types of equations that we can work with in algebra. An
equation gives the relationship between variables and numbers. Examples of sev-
eral relationships are below:
(x 3)2 (y+2)2
− =1 and y=x2 2x+7 and √y+x 7=xy
9 − 4 − −
There is a speical classification of relationships known as functions. Functions
have at most one output for any input. Generally x is the variable that we plug
into an equation and evaluate to find y. For this reason x is considered an input
variable and y is considered an output variable. This means the definition of a
function, in terms of equations in xandy could be said, for any x value there is at
most one y value that corresponds with it.
A great way to visualize this definition is to look at the graphs of a few relation-
ships. Because x values are vertical lines we will draw a vertical line through the
graph. If the vertical line crosses the graph more than once, that means we have
too many possible y values. If the graph crosses the graph only once, then we say
the relationship is a function.
386Example 504.
Which of the following graphs are graphs of functions?

once, it is a function.
bottom. This is not a

We can look at the above idea in an algebraic method by taking a relationship
and solving it for y. If we have only one solution then it is a function.
Example 505.

No! Notafunction
Once we know we have a function, often we will change the notation used to
emphasis the fact that it is a function. Instead of writing y = , we will use func-
tion notation which can be written f(x)=. We read this notation “f of x”. So for
387the above example that was a function, instead of writing y = 3x2 5, we could
−
have written f(x)=3x2 5. It is important to point out that f(x) does not mean
−
f times x, it is mearly a notation that names the function with the first letter
(function f) and then in parenthesis we are given information about what vari-
ables are in the function (variable x). The first letter can be anything we want it
to be, often you will see g(x) (read g of x).
World View Note: The concept of a function was first introduced by Arab
mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi in the late 12th century
Once we know a relationship is a function, we may be interested in what values
can be put into the equations. The values that are put into an equation (generally
the x values) are called the domain. When finding the domain, often it is easier
to consider what cannot happen in a given function, then exclude those values.

− (cid:2)
The notation in the previous example tells us that x can be any value except for
3and2. If x were one of those two values, the function would be undefined.

AllRealNumbersorR OurSolution
In the above example there are no real numbers that make the function unde-
fined. This means any number can be used for x.

The notation in the above example states that our variable can be or any
2
3
number larger than . But any number smaller would make the function unde-
2
fined (without using imaginary numbers).
Another use of function notation is to easily plug values into functions. If we want
to substitute a variable for a value (or an expression) we simply replace the vari-
able with what we want to plug in. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 510.

−
As the above examples show, the function can take many different forms, but the
pattern to evaluate the function is always the same, replace the variable with
what is in parenthesis and simplify. We can also substitute expressions into func-
tions using the same process. Often the expressions use the same variable, it is
important to remember each variable is replaced by whatever is in parenthesis.
Example 513.

It is important to become comfortable with function notation and how to use it as
we transition into more advanced algebra topics.

Functions - Operations on Functions
Objective: Combine functions using sum, difference, product, quotient
and composition of functions.
Several functions can work together in one larger function. There are 5 common
operations that can be performed on functions. The four basic operations on func-
tions are adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. The notation for these
functions is as follows.
Addition (f +g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)
Subtraction (f g)(x)=f(x) g(x)
− −
Multiplication (f g)(x)=f(x)g(x)
·

Division (x)=
g g(x)

When we do one of these four basic operations we can simply evaluate the two
functions at the value and then do the operation with both solutions

Often as we add, subtract, multiply, or divide functions, we do so in a way that
keeps the variable. If there is no number to plug into the equations we will simply
use each equation, in parenthesis, and simplify the expression.

the negative.

The fifth operation of functions is called composition of functions. A composition
of functions is a function inside of a function. The notation used for composition
of functions is:
(f g)(x)=f(g(x))
◦
To calculate a composition of function we will evaluate the inner function and
substitute the answer into the outer function. This is shown in the following
example.

Functions - Inverse Functions
Objective: Identify and find inverse functions.
When a value goes into a function it is called the input. The result that we get
when we evaluate the function is called the output. When working with functions
sometimes we will know the output and be interested in what input gave us the
output. To find this we use an inverse function. As the name suggests an inverse
function undoes whatever the function did. If a function is named f(x), the
inverse function will be named f 1(x) (read “f inverse of x”). The negative one is
−
not an exponent, but mearly a symbol to let us know that this function is the
inverse of f.
World View Note: The notation used for functions was first introduced by the
great Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler in the 18th century.
For example, if f(x)=x+5, we could deduce that the inverse function would be
f 1(x)=x 5. If we had an input of 3, we could calculate f(3)=(3)+5=8. Our
−
−
output is 8. If we plug this output into the inverse function we get f 1(8)=(8)
−
−
5=3, which is the original input.
Often the functions are much more involved than those described above. It may
be difficult to determine just by looking at the functions if they are inverses. In
order to test if two functions, f(x) and g(x) are inverses we will calculate the
composition of the two functions at x. If f changes the variable x in some way,
then g undoes whatever f did, then we will be back at x again for our final solu-
tion. In otherwords, if we simplify (f g)(x) the solution will be x. If it is any-
◦
thing but x the functions are not inverses.

While the composition is useful to show two functions are inverses, a more
common problem is to find the inverse of a function. If we think of x as our input
and y as our output from a function, then the inverse will take y as an input and
give x as the output. This means if we switch x and y in our function we will find
the inverse! This process is called the switch and solve strategy.
Switch and solve strategy to find an inverse:
1. Replace f(x) with y
2. Switch x and y’s
3. Solve for y
4. Replace y with f 1(x)

In this lesson we looked at two different things, first showing functions are
inverses by calculating the composition, and second finding an inverse when we
only have one function. Be careful not to get them backwards. When we already
have two functions and are asked to show they are inverses, we do not want to use
the switch and solve strategy, what we want to do is calculate the inverse. There
may be several ways to represent the same function so the switch and solve
strategy may not look the way we expect and can lead us to conclude two func-
tions are not inverses when they are in fact inverses.

Functions - Exponential Functions
Objective: Solve exponential equations by finding a common base.
As our study of algebra gets more advanced we begin to study more involved
functions. One pair of inverse functions we will look at are exponential functions
and logarithmic functions. Here we will look at exponential functions and then we
will consider logarithmic functions in another lesson. Exponential functions are
functions where the variable is in the exponent such as f(x)=ax. (It is important
not to confuse exponential functions with polynomial functions where the variable
is in the base such as f(x)=x2).
World View Note One common application of exponential functions is popula-
tion growth. According to the 2009 CIA World Factbook, the country with the
highest population growth rate is a tie between the United Arab Emirates (north
of Saudi Arabia) and Burundi (central Africa) at 3.69%. There are 32 countries
with negative growth rates, the lowest being the Northern Mariana Islands (north
of Australia) at 7.08%.
−
Solving exponetial equations cannot be done using the skill set we have seen in
the past. For example, if 3x = 9, we cannot take the x root of 9 because we do
−
not know what the index is and this doesn’t get us any closer to finding x. How-
ever, we may notice that 9 is 32. We can then conclude that if 3x=32 then x=2.
This is the process we will use to solve exponential functions. If we can re-write a
problem so the bases match, then the exponents must also match.
Example 529.

Sometimes we may have to do work on both sides of the equation to get a
common base. As we do so, we will use various exponent properties to help. First
we will use the exponent property that states (ax)y=axy.

If we have several factors with the same base on one side of the equation we can
add the exponents using the property that states axay=ax+y.

It may take a bit of practice to get use to knowing which base to use, but as we
practice we will get much quicker at knowing which base to use. As we do so, we
will use our exponent properties to help us simplify. Again, below are the proper-
ties we used to simplify.

We could see all three properties used in the same problem as we get a common

All the problems we have solved here we were able to write with a common base.
However, not all problems can be written with a common base, for example, 2 =
10x, we cannot write this problem with a common base. To solve problems like
this we will need to use the inverse of an exponential function. The inverse is
called a logarithmic function, which we will discuss in another secion.

Functions - Logarithmic Functions
Objective: Convert between logarithms and exponents and use that
relationship to solve basic logarithmic equations.
The inverse of an exponential function is a new function known as a logarithm.
Lograithms are studied in detail in advanced algebra, here we will take an intro-
ductory look at how logarithms works. When working with radicals we found that
m√an
there were two ways to write radicals. The expression could be written as

am. Each form has its advantages, thus we need to be comfortable using both the
radical form and the rational exponent form. Similarly an exponent can be
written in two forms, each with its own advantages. The first form we are very
familiar with, bx= a, where b is the base, a can be thought of as our answer, and
x is the exponent. The second way to write this is with a logarithm, log a = x.
b
The word “log” tells us that we are in this new form. The variables all still mean
the same thing. b is still the base, a can still be thought of as our answer.
Using this idea the problem 52 = 25 could also be written as log 25 = 2. Both
5
mean the same thing, both are still the same exponent problem, but just as roots
can be written in radical form or rational exponent form, both our forms have
their own advantages. The most important thing to be comfortable doing with
logarithms and exponents is to be able to switch back and forth between the two
forms. This is what is shown in the next few examples.

Once we are comfortable switching between logarithmic and exponential form we
are able to evaluate and solve logarithmic expressions and equations. We will first
evaluate logarithmic expressions. An easy way to evaluate a logarithm is to set
the logarithm equal to x and change it into an exponential equation.

There is one base on a logarithm that gets used more often than any other base,
base 10. Similar to square roots not writting the common index of 2 in the rad-
ical, we don’t write the common base of 10 in the logarithm. So if we are working
on a problem with no base written we will always assume that base is base 10.

Functions - Compound Interest
Objective: Calculate final account balances using the formulas for com-
pound and continuous interest.
An application of exponential functions is compound interest. When money is
invested in an account (or given out on loan) a certain amount is added to the
balance. This money added to the balance is called interest. Once that interest is
added to the balance, it will earn more interest during the next compounding
period. This idea of earning interest on interest is called compound interest. For
example, if you invest S100 at 10% interest compounded annually, after one year
you will earn S10 in interest, giving you a new balance of S110. The next year
you will earn another 10% or S11, giving you a new balance of S121. The third
year you will earn another 10% or S12.10, giving you a new balance of S133.10.
This pattern will continue each year until you close the account.
There are several ways interest can be paid. The first way, as described above, is
compounded annually. In this model the interest is paid once per year. But
interest can be compounded more often. Some common compounds include com-
pounded semi-annually (twice per year), quarterly (four times per year, such as
quarterly taxes), monthly (12 times per year, such as a savings account), weekly
(52 times per year), or even daily (365 times per year, such as some student
loans). When interest is compounded in any of these ways we can calculate the
balance after any amount of time using the following formula:
r nt
CompoundInterestFormula:A=P 1+
n
A=Fi(cid:16)nalAmo(cid:17)unt
P =Principle(startingbalance)
r=Interestrate(asadecimal)
n=numberofcompoundsperyear
t=time(inyears)
Example 544.
If you take a car loan for S25000 with an interest rate of 6.5% compounded quar-
terly, no payments required for the first five years, what will your balance be at
the end of those five years?

It is interesting to compare equal investments that are made at several different
types of compounds. The next few examples do just that.
Example 546.

415To investigate what happens to the balance if the compounds happen more often,
we will consider the same problem, this time with interest compounded daily.
Example 547.

the balance after 7 years?

S4934.67 OurSolution
While this difference is not very large, it is a bit higher. The table below shows
the result for the same problem with different compounds.

Semi-Annually S4927.02
Quarterly S4930.85
Monthly S4933.42
Weekly S4934.41
Daily S4934.67
As the table illustrates, the more often interest is compounded, the higher the
final balance will be. The reason is, because we are calculating compound interest
or interest on interest. So once interest is paid into the account it will start
earning interest for the next compound and thus giving a higher final balance.
The next question one might consider is what is the maximum number of com-
pounds possible? We actually have a way to calculate interest compounded an
infinite number of times a year. This is when the interest is compounded continu-
ously. When we see the word “continuously” we will know that we cannot use the
first formula. Instead we will use the following formula:
InterestCompoundedContinuously:A=Pert
A=FinalAmount
P =Principle(startingbalance)
e=aconstantapproximately2.71828183 .
(cid:9)
r=Interestrate(writtenasadecimal)
t=time(years)
416The variable e is a constant similar in idea to pi (π) in that it goes on forever
without repeat or pattern, but just as pi (π) naturally occurs in several geometry
applications, so does e appear in many exponential applications, continuous
interest being one of them. If you have a scientific calculator you probably have
an e button (often using the 2nd or shift key, then hit ln) that will be useful in
calculating interest compounded continuously.
World View Note: e first appeared in 1618 in Scottish mathematician’s
Napier’s work on logarithms. However it was Euler in Switzerland who used the
letter e first to represent this value. Some say he used e because his name begins
with E. Others, say it is because exponent starts with e. Others say it is because
Euler’s work already had the letter a in use, so e would be the next value. What-
ever the reason, ever since he used it in 1731, e became the natural base.

pound interest. Consider the following example, illustrating how powerful com-
pound interest can be.

Functions - Trigonometric Functions
Objective: Solve for a missing side of a right triangle using trigono-
metric ratios.
There are six special functions that describe the relationship between the sides of
a right triangle and the angles of the triangle. We will discuss three of the func-
tions here. The three functions are called the sine, cosine, and tangent (the three
others are cosecant, secant, and cotangent, but we will not need to use them
here).
To the right is a picture of a right tri-
angle. Based on which angle we are
interested in on a given problem we
will name the three sides in relation-
Hypotenuse
ship to that angle. In the picture, Opposite
angle A is the angle we will use to
name the other sides. The longest side,
the side opposite the right angle is
A
always called the hypotenouse. The
Adjacent
side across from the angle A is called
the opposite side.
The third side, the side between our angle and the right angle is called the adja-
cent side. It is important to remember that the opposite and adjacent sides are
named in relationship to the angle A or the angle we are using in a problem. If
the angle had been the top angle, the opposite and adjacent sides would have
been switched.
The three trigonometric funtions are functions taken of angles. When an angle
goes into the function, the output is a ratio of two of the triangle sides. The
ratios are as describe below:
opposite adjacent opposite
sinθ= cosθ= tanθ=
hypotenuse hypotenuse adjacent
The “weird” variable θ is a greek letter, pronounced “theta” and is close in idea to
our letter “t”. Often working with triangles, the angles are repesented with Greek
letters, in honor of the Ancient Greeks who developed much of Geometry. Some
students remember the three ratios by remembering the word “SOH CAH TOA”
where each letter is the first word of: “Sine: Opposite over Hypotenuse; Cosine:
Adjacent over Hypotenuse; and Tangent: Opposite over Adjacent.” Knowing how
to use each of these relationships is fundamental to solving problems using
trigonometry.
World View Note: The word “sine” comes from a mistranslation of the Arab
word jayb
Example 550.
420Using the diagram at right, find each
of the following: sinθ, cosθ, tanθ, sinα, 8
cosα,andtanα. 6
α θ
First we will find the three ratios of θ.
The hypotenuse is 10, from θ, the 10
opposite side is 6 and the adjacent
side is 8. So we fill in the following:
sinθ= opposite = 6 = 3
hypotenuse 10 5
Adjacent of θ
cosθ= adjacent = 8 = 4 Opposite of α
hypotenuse 10 5
8
tanθ= opposite = 6 = 3 6
adjacent 8 4 Opposite of θ θ
α
Now we will find the three ratios of α. Adjacent of α 10
The hypotenuse is 10, from α, the Hypotenuse
opposite side is 8 and the adjacent
side is 6. So we fill in the following:
sinα= opposite = 8 = 4
hypotenuse 10 5
cosα= adjacent = 6 = 3
hypotenuse 10 5
tanα= opposite = 8 = 4
adjacent 6 3
We can either use a trigonometry table or a calculator to find decimal values for
sine, cosine, or tangent of any angle. We only put angle values into the trigono-
metric functions, never values for sides. Using either a table or a calculator, we
can solve the next example.

By combining the ratios together with the decimal approximations the calculator
or table gives us, we can solve for missing sides of a triangle. The trick will be to
determine which angle we are working with, naming the sides we are working
with, and deciding which trig function can be used with the sides we have.

Functions - Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Objective: Solve for missing angles of a right triangle using inverse
trigonometry.
We used a special function, one of the trig functions, to take an angle of a triangle
and find the side length. Here we will do the opposite, take the side lengths and
find the angle. Because this is the opposite operation, we will use the inverse
function of each of the trig ratios we saw before. The notation we will use for the
inverse trig functions will be similar to the inverse notation we used with func-
tions.

sin−1 =θ cos−1 =θ tan−1 =θ

Just as with inverse functions, the 1 is not an exponent, it is a notation to tell
−
us that these are inverse functions. While the regular trig functions take angles as
inputs, these inverse functions will always take a ratio of sides as inputs. We can
calculate inverse trig values using a table or a calculator (usually pressing shift or
2nd first).

If we have two sides of a triangle, we can easily calculate their ratio as a decimal
and then use one of the inverse trig functions to find a missing angle.
Example 555.
Find the indicated angle.
428From angle θ the given sides are the
opposite (12) and the hypotenuse (17).

17
The trig function that uses opposite
and hypotenuse is the sine

Using a combination of trig functions and inverse trig functions, if we are given
two parts of a right triangle (two sides or a side and an angle), we can find all the
other sides and angles of the triangle. This is called solving a triangle.
When we are solving a triangle, we can use trig ratios to solve for all the missing
parts of it, but there are some properties from geometry that may be helpful
along the way.
The angles of a triangle always add up to 180 , because we have a right triangle,
◦
90 are used up in the right angle, that means there are another 90 left in the
◦ ◦
two acute angles. In other words, the smaller two angles will always add to 90, if
we know one angle, we can quickly find the other by subtracting from 90.
Another trick is on the sides of the angles. If we know two sides of the right tri-
angle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the third side. The
Pythagorean Theorem states that if c is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and a and
429b are the other two sides (legs), then we can use the following formula, a2+b2=c2
to find a missing side.
Often when solving triangles we use trigonometry to find one part, then use the
angle sum and/or the Pythagorean Theorem to find the other two parts.
Example 557.
Solve the triangle
We have one angle and one side. We
can use these to find either other side.
We will find the other leg, the adja-
5 cent side to the 35 angle.
◦
The 5 is the opposite side, so we will
35 ◦ use the tangent to find the leg.

The angle sum and pythagorean theorem are just nice shortcuts to solve the
problem quicker.
Example 558.

In this triangle we have two sides. We
will first find the angle on the right
side, adjacent to 3 and opposite from
the 9.
