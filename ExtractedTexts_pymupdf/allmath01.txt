Chapter 1
Whole Numbers
The natural numbers are the counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... . The dots indicate that the sequence
is inﬁnite – counting can go on forever, since you can always get the next number by simply adding 1
to the previous number. In order to write numbers eﬃciently, and for other reasons, we also need the
number 0. Later on, we will need the sequence of negative numbers −1, −2, −3, −4, −5, −6, ... . Taken
together, all these numbers are called the integers.
It helps to visualize the integers laid out on a number line, with 0 in the middle, and the natural
numbers increasing to the right. There are numbers between any two integers on the number line. In
fact, every location on the line represents some number. Some locations represent fractions such as
one-half (between 0 and 1) or four-thirds (between 1 and 2). Other locations represent numbers which
cannot be expressed as fractions, such as π. (π is located between 3 and 4 and expresses the ratio of
the circumference to the diameter of any circle.)

For now, we concentrate on the non-negative integers (including 0), which we call whole numbers.
We need only ten symbols to write any whole number. These symbols are the digits
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
We write larger whole numbers using a place-value system.
The digit in the right-most place
indicates how many ones the number contains, the digit in the second-from-right place indicates how
many tens the number contains, the digit in the third-from-right place indicates how many hundreds
the number contains, etc.
Example 1.
7 stands for
7 ones
72 stands for
7 tens + 2 ones
349 stands for
3 hundreds + 4 tens + 9 ones
6040 stands for
6 thousands + 0 hundreds + 4 tens + 0 ones
Notice that when you move left, the place value increases ten-fold. So if a number has ﬁve digits,
the ﬁfth-from-right place indicates how many ten-thousands the number contains. (Ten-thousand is ten
times a thousand.)

Adding Whole Numbers
When we add two or more integers, the result is called the sum. We assume you know the sums of
single-digit numbers. For practice, do the following example.
Example 2. Fill in the missing squares in the digit-addition table below. For example, the number in
the row labelled 3 and the column labelled 4 is the sum 3 + 4 = 7.

Table 1.1: The digit addition table
1. Do you notice any patterns or regularities in the digit-addition table? Can you explain them?
2. Why is the second line from the top identical to the top line?
3. What can you say about the left-most column and the second-from-left column?
1.1.1
Commutativity, Associativity, Identity
The ﬁrst question leads us to an important property of addition, namely, that for any two numbers x
and y,
x + y = y + x.
Page 10
In other words, the order in which two numbers are added does not eﬀect the sum. This property of
addition is called commutativity.
The last two questions lead us to an important property of 0, namely, for any number x,
x + 0 = x = 0 + x.
In other words, when 0 is added to any number, x, you get the identical number, x, again. Because of
this property, 0 is called the additive identity.
One ﬁnal property of addition is expressed in the following equation
(x + y) + z = x + (y + z),
which says that if three numbers are added, it doesn’t matter how you “associate” the additions: you
can add the ﬁrst two numbers ﬁrst, and then add the third to that, or, you could add the second two
numbers ﬁrst, and then add the ﬁrst to that. This property of addition is called associativity.
Example 3. Find the sum of 2, 3, and 5 by associating in two diﬀerent ways.
Solution. Associating 2 and 3, we calculate
(2 + 3) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10.
On the other hand, associating 3 and 5, we calculate
2 + (3 + 5) = 2 + 8 = 10.
The sum is the same in both cases.
1.1.2
Multi-digit addition
To add numbers with more than one digit, we line up the numbers vertically so that the ones places
(right-most) are directly on top of each other, and all other places are similarly arranged. Then we add
the digits in each place to obtain the sum.
Example 4. Find the sum of 25 and 134.
Solution. We line up the numbers vertically so that the 5 in the ones place of 25 is over the 4 in the
ones place of 134. If we do this carefully, all the other places line up vertically, too. So there is a “ones”
column, a “tens” column to the left of it, and a “hundreds” column to the left of that:
2 5
1 3 4
Then we draw a line and add the digits in each column to get the sum:
2 5
+
1 3 4
1 5 9
Page 11
Sometimes we need to “carry” a digit from one place to the next higher place. For example, when
adding 38 + 47, we ﬁrst add the ones places, 8 + 7 = 15. But 15 has two digits: it stands for 1 ten
+ 5 ones. We “put down” the 5 in the ones place, and “carry” the 1 (standing for a ten) to the tens
column. So we have:
Example 5. Find the sum
3 8
+
4 7
Solution. Put down the 5 in the ones place:
3 8
+
4 7
5
and carry the 1 to the top of the tens column:
{1}
3 8
+
4 7
5
and ﬁnish the job by adding up the tens column, including the carried one:
{1}
3 8
+
4 7
8 5
The sum is 85.
Since carrying alters the sum in the column immediately to the left of the one we are working on,
in multi-digit addition, we always start with the right-most column and proceed leftward.

Subtracting Whole Numbers
Another way to say that 5 + 2 = 7 is to say that 5 = 7 − 2. In words, “5 is the diﬀerence of 7 and 2,”
or “5 is the result of taking away 2 from 7.” The operation of taking away one number from another,
or ﬁnding their diﬀerence, is called subtraction. For now, we have to be careful that the number we
take away is no larger than the number we start with: we cannot have 3 marbles and take 7 of them
away! Later on, when we introduce negative numbers, we won’t have to worry about this.
We assume you remember the diﬀerences of single-digit numbers. Just to make sure, do the following
example.
Example 6. Fill in the missing squares in the digit-subtraction table below. Here’s a start: the number
in the row labelled 7 and the column labelled 2 is the diﬀerence 7− 2 = 5. The digit in the row labelled
3 and the column labelled 3 is the diﬀerence 3 − 3 = 0. (Squares that have an asterisk (∗) will be ﬁlled
in later with negative numbers.)

Table 1.2: The digit subtraction table
1.2.1
Commutativity, Associativity, Identity
When we study negative numbers, we will see that subtraction is not commutative. We can see by a
simple example that subtraction is also not associative.
Example 7. Verify that (7 − 4) − 2 is not equal to 7 − (4 − 2).
Solution. Associating the 7 and 4, we get
(7 − 4) − 2 = 3 − 2 = 1,
but associating the 4 and the 2, we get
7 − (4 − 2) = 7 − 2 = 5,
a diﬀerent answer. Until we establish an order of operations, we will avoid examples like this!
It is true that
x − 0 = x
for any number x. However, 0 is not an identity for subtraction, since 0 − x is not equal to 0 (unless
x = 0). To make sense of 0 − x, we will need negative numbers.
1.2.2
Multi-digit subtractions
To perform subtractions of multi-digit numbers, we need to distinguish the number “being diminished”
from the number which is “doing the diminishing” (being taken away). The latter number is called the
subtrahend, and the former, the minuend. For now, we take care that the subtrahend is no larger than
the minuend.
To set up the subtraction, we line the numbers up vertically, with the minuend over the subtrahend,
and the ones places lined up on the right.
Example 8. Find the diﬀerence of 196 and 43.
Solution. The subtrahend is 43 (the smaller number), so it goes on the bottom. We line up the numbers
vertically so that the 6 in the ones place of 196 is over the 3 in the ones place of 43.
1 9 6
4 3
Then we draw a line and subtract the digits in each column, starting with the ones column and
working right to left, to get the diﬀerence:
Page 15
1 9 6
−
4 3
1 5 3
1.2.3
Checking Subtractions
Subtraction is the “opposite” of addition, so any subtraction problem can be restated in terms of
addition. Using the previous example, and adding the diﬀerence to the subtrahend, we obtain
1 5 3
+
4 3
1 9 6
which is the original minuend. In general, if subtraction has been performed correctly, adding the
diﬀerence to the subtrahend returns the minuend. This gives us a good way to check subtractions.
Example 9. Check whether the following subtraction is correct:
9 4
−
5 1
3 3
Solution. Adding the (supposed) diﬀerence to the subtrahend, we get
3 3
+
5 1
8 4
which is not equal to the minuend (94). Thus the subtraction is incorrect. We leave it to you to ﬁx
it!
1.2.4
Borrowing
Sometimes, when subtracting, we need to “borrow” a digit from a higher place and add its equivalent
to a lower place.
Example 10. Find the diﬀerence:
8 5
−
4 6
Solution. The digit subtraction in the ones column is not possible (we can’t take 6 from 5). Instead
we remove or ”borrow” 1 ten from the tens place of the minuend, and convert it into 10 ones, which
we add to the ones in the ones place of the minuend. The minuend is now represented as {7}{15},
Page 16
standing for 7 tens + 15 ones. It looks funny (as if 15 were a digit), but it doesn’t change the value of
the minuend, which is still 7 × 10 + 15 = 85. We represent the borrowing operation like this:
{7}{15}
8
5
−
4
6
Ignoring the original minuend, we have 15 − 6 = 9 for the ones place, and 7 − 3 = 4 for the tens place,
as follows:
{7}{15}
8
5
−
4
6
3
9
The diﬀerence is 39. We can check this by verifying that the diﬀerence + the subtrahend = the original
minuend:
3 9
+
4 6
8 5
Sometimes you have to go more than one place to the left to borrow successfully. This happens
when the next higher place has a 0 digit – there is nothing to borrow from.
Example 11. Find the diﬀerence:
2 0 7
−
6 9
Solution. In the ones column we can’t take 9 from 7, so we need to borrow from a higher place. We
can’t borrow from the tens place, because it has 0 tens. But we can borrow from the hundreds place.
We borrow 1 hundred, and convert it into 9 tens and 10 ones. The minuend is now represented as
{1}{9}{17}, standing for 1 hundred + 9 tens + 17 ones, (as if 17 were a digit). We represent the
borrowing as before:
{1}{9}{17}
2
0
7
−
6
9
Ignoring the original minuend, we have 17 − 9 = 8 for the ones place, 9 − 6 = 3 for the tens place, and
1 − 0 = 1 for the hundreds place:
{1}{9}{17}
2
0
7
−
6

Page 17
The diﬀerence is 138. To check, we verify that the diﬀerence + the subtrahend = the original minuend:
1 3 8
+
6 9
2 0 7
(You may have noticed that the carrying you do in the addition check simply reverses the borrowing
done in the original subtraction!)

Multiplying Whole Numbers
Multiplication is really just repeated addition. When we say “4 times 3 equals 12,” we can think of it
as starting at 0 and adding 3 four times over:
0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12.
We can leave out the 0, since 0 is the additive identity ( 0+3 = 3). Using the symbol × for multiplication,
we write
3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 4 × 3 = 12.
The result of multiplying two or more numbers is called the product of the numbers. Instead of the ×
symbol, we often use a central dot (·) to indicate a product. Thus, for example, instead of 2 × 4 = 8,
we can write
2 · 4 = 8.
Example 12. We assume you remember the products of small whole numbers, so it should be easy for
you to reproduce the partial multiplication table below. For example, the number in the row labelled 7
and the column labelled 5 is the product 7 · 5 = 35.

Table 1.3: Multiplication table
1. Do you notice any patterns or regularities in the multiplication table? Can you explain them?
2. Why does the second row from the top contain only 0’s?
3. Why is the third row from the top identical to the ﬁrst row?
4. Is multiplication commutative? How can you tell from the table?
Page 20
1.3.1
Commutativity, Associativity, Identity, the Zero Property
An examination of the multiplication table leads us to an important property of 0, namely, when any
number, N, is multiplied by 0, the product is 0:
0 · N = N · 0 = 0.
It also shows us an important property of 1, namely, when any number, N, is multiplied by 1, the
product is the identical number, x, again:
1 · N = N · 1 = N.
For this reason, 1 is called the multiplicative identity.
The following example should help you to see that multiplication is commutative.
Example 13. The ﬁgure shows two ways of piling up twelve small squares. On the left, we have piled
up 3 rows of 4 squares (3 × 4); on the right, we have piled up 4 rows of 3 squares (4 × 3). In both
cases, of course, the total number of squares is the product 3 × 4 = 4 × 3 = 12.
Figure 1.1: 3 × 4 = 4 × 3 = 12
Examples like the following help you to see that multiplication is associative.
Example 14. We can ﬁnd the product 3 × 4 × 5 in two diﬀerent ways. We could ﬁrst associate 3 and
4, getting
(3 × 4) × 5 = 12 × 5 = 60,
or we could ﬁrst associate 4 and 5, getting
3 × (4 × 5) = 3 × 20 = 60.
The product is the same in both cases.
1.3.2
Multi-digit multiplications
To multiply numbers when one of them has more than one digit, we need to distinguish the number
“being multiplied” from the number which is “doing the multiplying.” The latter number is called the
multiplier, and the former, the multiplicand. It really makes no diﬀerence which number is called the
multiplier and which the multiplicand (because multiplication is commutative!). But it saves space if
we choose the multiplier to be the number with the fewest digits.
To set up the multiplication, we line the numbers up vertically, with the multiplicand over the
multiplier, and the ones places lined up on the right.
Page 21
Example 15. To multiply 232 by 3, we write
2 3 2
×
3
We multiply place-by-place, putting the products in the appropriate column. 3 × 2 ones is 6 ones, so
we put 6 in the ones place
2 3 2
×
3
6
3 × 3 tens is 9 tens, so we put 9 in the tens place
2 3 2
×
3
9 6
Finally, 3 × 2 hundreds is 6 hundreds, so that we put down 6 in the hundreds place, and we are
done:
2 3 2
×
3
6 9 6
Sometimes we need to carry a digit from one place to the next higher place, as in addition. For
example, 4 × 5 = 20, a number with two digits. So we would “put down” the 0 in the current place,
and “carry” the 2 to the column representing the next higher place, as in the next example.
Example 16. Multiply 251 by 4.
Solution. The steps are
2 5 1
×
4
For the ones place,
2 5 1
×
4
4
For the tens place, 4 × 5 = 20, so we put down the 0 in the tens place and carry the 2 to the hundreds
column:
{2}
2 5 1
×
4
0 4
Page 22
For the hundreds place, 4 × 2 hundreds is 8 hundreds, to which we add the 2 hundreds that were
carried. This gives us 10 hundreds, or 1 thousand. We put down 0 in the hundreds place, and 1 in the
thousands place.
{2}
2 5 1
×
4
1 0 0 4
The product of 251 and 4 is 1004.
If the multiplier has more than one digit, the procedure is a little more complicated. We get partial
products (one for each digit of the multiplier) which are added to yield the total product.
Example 17. Consider the product
2 4
×
3 2
Since the multiplier stands for 3 tens + 2 ones, we can split the product into two partial products
2 4
×
2
4 8
and
2 4
×
3
Notice that in the second partial product the multiplier is in the tens column. This is almost exactly
like having a 1-digit multiplier. The second partial product is obtained by simply putting down a 0 in
the ones place and shifting the digit products one place to the left:
2 4
×
3
7 2 0
(Notice that we put down 2 and carried 1 when we performed the digit product 3 × 4 = 12.) The total
product is the sum of the two partial products: 48 + 720 = 768. We can write the whole procedure
compactly by aligning the two partial products vertically
2 4
×
3 2
4 8
7 2 0
Page 23
and then performing the addition
2 4
×
3 2
4 8
+
7 2 0
7 6 8
Here’s another example.
Example 18. Find the product of 29 and 135.
Solution. We choose 29 as the multiplier since it has the fewest digits.
1 3 5
×
2 9
We use the 1-digit multiplier 9 to obtain the ﬁrst partial product
{3}{4}
1 3 5
×
2 9
1 2 1 5
Notice that we put down 5 and carried 4 to the tens place, and also put down 1 and carried 3 to the
hundreds place. Next we use the 1-digit multiplier 2 (standing for 2 tens) to obtain the second partial
product, shifted left by putting a 0 in the ones place
{1}
1 3 5
×
2 9
1 2 1 5
2 7 0 0
(What carry did we perform?) Finally, we add the partial products to obtain the (total) product
1 3 5
×
2 9
1 2 1 5
+
2 7 0 0
3 9 1 5
Note that the whole procedure is compactly recorded in the last step, which is all that you need to write
down.

Powers of Whole Numbers
If we start with 1 and repeatedly multiply by 3, 4 times over, we get a number that is called the 4th
power of 3, written
34 = 1 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.
The factor of 1 is understood and usually omitted. Instead we simply write
34 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.
In the expression 34, 3 is called the base, and 4 the exponent (or power).
Example 19. The 5th power of 2, or 25, is the product
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 32.
The 3rd power of 4, or 43, is the product
4 × 4 × 4 = 64.
We make the following deﬁnition in the cases where the exponent is 0.
Page 26
For any nonzero number N,
N0 = 1.
(00 is undeﬁned.)
This makes sense if you remember the harmless factor of 1 that is understood in every exponential
expression. (You’ll see another justiﬁcation when you study algebra.)
Although 00 is undeﬁned, expressions such as 02, 03, etc., with 0 base and nonzero exponent, make
perfect sense (e.g., 03 = 0 × 0 × 0 = 0).
Example 20. 170 = 1.
05 = 0.
01 = 0.
00 is undeﬁned.
1.4.1
Squares and Cubes
Certain powers are so familiar that they have special names. For example, the 2nd power is called the
square and the 3rd power is called the cube. Thus 52 is read “5 squared,” and 73 is read as “7 cubed.”
The source of these special names is geometric (see Section 1.8). The area of a square, x units on a
side, is x2 square units. This means that the square contains x2 small squares, each one unit on a side.
For example, the ﬁgure below shows a square 6 units on a side, with area 62 = 36 square units.
=
Similarly, the volume of a cube, y units on a side, is y 3 cubic units. This means that the cube
contains y 3 little cubes, each one unit on a side. For example, the volume of an ice cube that measures
2 cm (centimeters) on a side is 23 = 8 cubic centimeters.

Square Roots
If there is a number, whose square is the number n, we call it the square root of n, and symbolize it by
√n.
For example, 22 = 4, so 2 is the square root of 4, and we write
√
4 = 2.
Similarly, 32 = 9, so 3 is the square root of 9, and we write
√
9 = 3.
Actually, every positive whole number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. The positive
square root is called the principal square root, and, for now, when we say square root, we mean the
principal one.
A whole number whose square root is also a whole number is called a perfect square. The ﬁrst few
perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121. Clearly, there are lots of whole numbers
that are not perfect squares. But these numbers must have square roots. Using our geometric intuition,
it is easy to believe that there are geometric squares whose areas are not perfect square numbers. For
example, if we want to construct a square whose area is 5 square units, we could start with a square
whose area is 4 square units, and steadily expand it on all sides until we get the desired square.
Area=4
Area = 5
Area = 9

The side length of the middle square is a number which, when squared, yields 5, that is,
√
5. We can
see that
√
5 is bigger than
√
4 = 2, and less than
√
9 = 3.
In general, if a whole number lies between two perfect squares, its square root must lie between the
two corresponding square roots.
Example 21. Since 21 lies between the perfect squares 16 and 25,
√
21 must lie between
√
16 = 4 and
√
25 = 5.
Example 22. Between what two consecutive whole numbers does
√
53 lie?
Solution. Since 53 lies between the perfect squares 49 and 64, the square root
√
53 must lie between
√
49 = 7 and
√
64 = 8.

Division of Whole Numbers
How many times does 23 “go into” 100? Put another way, starting with 100, how many times can we
subtract 23 without obtaining a negative number? The answer is easily seen to be 4. Moreover, it is
Page 29
easy to see that there is something “left over,” namely, 8. Here are the computations:
1 0 0
−
2 3
7 7
−
2 3
5 4
−
2 3
3 1
−
2 3
8
This operation (repeated subtraction) is called division. The number we start with (100 in the example)
is called the dividend, and the number we repeatedly subtract (23 in the example) is called the divisor.
We use the symbol ÷, and note that the dividend is written ﬁrst:
dividend ÷ divisor.
1.5.1
Quotient and Remainder
Unlike the other three operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), the result of a division of whole
numbers consists of not one but two whole numbers: the number of subtractions performed (4 in the
example), and the number left over (8 in the example). These two numbers are called the quotient
and the remainder, respectively.
Whole number divisions with remainder 0 are called exact. For example, 48 ÷ 6 has quotient 8 and
remainder 0, so the division is exact and we can write
48 ÷ 6 = 8,
with the understanding that the remainder is 0. Exact divisions can be restated in terms of multiplication.
Subtracting 6 (8 times) from 48 yields exactly 0. On the other hand, starting at 0 and adding 6 (8
times) returns 48. Recalling that multiplication is a shorthand for this kind of repeated addition, we see
that the two statements
48 ÷ 6 = 8
and
48 = 6 · 8
say exactly the same thing. In general,
a ÷ b = c
and
a = b · c
are equivalent statements.
Example 23. Express the statement 72 = 8 · 9 as an exact division in two ways.
Solution. We can get to 0 by starting at 72 and repeatedly subtracting 8 (9 times), or by repeatedly
subtracting 8 (9 times). So, using the division symbol, we can write
72 ÷ 8 = 9
or we can write
72 ÷ 9 = 8.
Page 30
Example 24. The division 63 ÷ 7 is exact. Express this fact using an appropriate multiplication.
Solution. Since the quotient is 9 and the remainder is 0, we can write
63 ÷ 7 = 9
or
63 = 9 · 7.
1.5.2
Long Division
Divisions with multi-digit divisors and/or dividends can get complicated, so we remind you of a standard
way (long division) of organizing the computations. Here is what it looks like:
dividend
divisor
quotient
***
***
***
***
***
remainder
The horizontal lines indicate subtractions of intermediate numbers; there is one subtraction for each
digit in the quotient. For example, the fact that the division 100 ÷ 23 has quotient 4 and remainder 8
is expressed in the long division form as follows:
1 0 0
2 3
4
− 9 2
8
The 4 repeated subtractions of 23 are summarized as the single subtraction of 4 · 23 = 92.
In long division, we try to estimate the number of repeated subtractions that will be needed, multiply
this estimate by the divisor, and hope for a number that is close to, but not greater than, the dividend.
It will be easy to see when our estimate is too large, and to adjust it downward. If it is too small, the
result of the subtraction will be too big – there was actually “room” for further subtraction. Going
back to our example, 100 ÷ 23, it is more or less clear that we will need more than 2 subtractions, since
23 × 2 = 46, which leaves a big remainder of 54 (bigger than the divisor, 23). 23 × 3 = 69, which also
leaves a remainder that is too big. Since 23×5 = 115, which is bigger than the dividend, 100, we know
that the best estimate for the quotient is 4. Now 23 × 4 = 92. We subtract 92 from 100, leaving the
remainder 8, which is less than the divisor, as it should be. To check our calculations, we verify that
23 × 4 + 8 = 100. (In this check, the multiplication is done before the addition – this is the standard
Page 31
order of operations, which we will say more about later.)
Let’s try another simple division problem.
Example 25. Find the quotient and remainder of the division 162 ÷ 42.
Solution. Putting the dividend and divisor into the long division form, we have
1 6 2
4 2
Let’s estimate the number of subtractions that we’ll need to perform. 40 goes into 160 four times, so,
perhaps four is a good guess. But 4 × 42 = 168, which is too big (bigger than the dividend). So we
lower our estimate by 1. We get 3 × 42 = 126, which is less than the dividend, so this must be the
right choice.
1 6 2
4 2
3
−1 2 6
Subtracting, we obtain the remainder
1 6 2
4 2
3
−1 2 6
3 6
which is less than the divisor, as it should be. Thus, the quotient is 3 and the remainder is 36. As a
check, we verify that 3 × 42 + 36 = 162. (Multiplication before addition.)
Page 32
When the dividend is large, estimating the quotient is not so easy. The next example shows how to
break the problem down by considering related, but smaller dividends.
Example 26. Find the quotient and remainder of the division 3060 ÷ 15.
Solution. If we read the dividend from the left, one digit at a time, we get, successively, the numbers 3,
30, 306, and 3060. Of course, according to the place-value system, these numbers stand for 3 thousands,
30 hundreds, etc., but we do not need to think this way. To ﬁnd the left-most digit of the quotient,
observe that the divisor, 15, does not “go into” 3, but it does go into 30 (2 times, exactly). To indicate
this we put, for the ﬁrst digit of the quotient, the digit 2, directly over the right-most digit (0) in 30:
3 0 6 0
1 5
2
Now we compute the product 15×2 = 30 and subtract it from the initially selected part of the dividend,
i.e., from 30:
3 0 6 0
1 5
2
− 3 0
0
In this case, we get a remainder of 0. But we are not done yet. We treat this intermediate remainder
as if it were a new dividend. Does 15 “go into” 0? No – we need a larger dividend. To get one, we
“bring down” the digit 6:
3060
15
2
− 30
06
Now 06 = 6 (why?), and 15 does not go into 6. More precisely, it goes into it 0 times. We indicate
this by putting a 0 directly above the digit 6 in the dividend:
Page 33
3060
15
20
− 30
06
Then we bring down the next (and the last) digit (0) of the dividend:
3060
15
20
− 30
060
This gives us a new dividend of 060 = 60, and 15 goes into 60 four times. So we put down 4 above the
ﬁnal digit in the original dividend.
3060
15
204
− 30
060
Multiplying 15 by 4, we subtract this product from 60. This ﬁnal diﬀerence is the remainder.
Page 34
3060
15
204
− 30
060

0
We have reached the end of our dividend – there are no more digits to bring down. Hence, our division
stops. The quotient is 204, and the remainder is 0. We check by verifying that 15×204+0 = 3060.

Order of operations
We often do calculations that involve more than one operation. For example
1 + 2 × 3
involves both addition and multiplication. Which do we do ﬁrst? If we do the multiplication ﬁrst, the
result is 1 + 6 = 7, and if we do the addition ﬁrst, the result is 3 × 3 = 9. Obviously, if we want the
expression
1 + 2 × 3
to have a deﬁnite and unambiguous meaning, we need a convention or agreement about the order of
operations. It could have been otherwise, but the convention in this case is:
multiplication before addition.
With this convention, when I write 1 + 2 × 3, you know that I mean 7 (not 9). The precedence of
multiplication can be made explicit using the grouping symbols () (parentheses):
1 + (2 × 3) = 1 + 6 = 7.
If one of us insists that the addition be done ﬁrst, we can do that by re-setting the parentheses:
(1 + 2) × 3 = 3 × 3 = 9.
Thus grouping symbols can be used to force any desired order of operations. Common grouping symbols,
besides parentheses, are brackets, [ ], and braces, {}. The square root symbol √ is also a grouping
symbol. For example
√
4 + 5 =
√
9 = 3.
The √ symbol acts like a pair of parentheses, telling us to evaluate what is inside (in this case, the
sum 4 + 5) ﬁrst, before taking the square root.
The order of operations is:
1. operations within grouping symbols ﬁrst;
2. exponents and roots next;
3. multiplications and divisions (in order of appearance) next;
4. additions and subtractions (in order of appearance) last.
“In order of appearance” means in order from left to right. Thus in the expression
2 + 5 − 3,
the addition comes ﬁrst, so it is evaluated ﬁrst,
2 + 5 − 3 = 7 − 3 = 4,
while in the expression
8 − 6 + 11,
the subtraction is done ﬁrst because it comes ﬁrst,
8 − 6 + 11 = 2 + 11 = 13.
Page 36
Example 27. Evaluate 6 · 5 − 4 ÷ 2 + 2.
Solution. All four operations appear here. There are no grouping symbols, exponents or roots. Following
the order of operations, as well as the order of appearance, we do the computations in the following
order: multiplication, division, subtraction, addition. The computations are as follows:
6 · 5 − 4 ÷ 2 + 2 =
30 − 4 ÷ 2 + 2 =
30 − 2 + 2 =
28 + 2 =
30
In the next two examples, we use the same numbers and the same operations, but we insert grouping
symbols to change the order of operations. As expected, this changes the ﬁnal result.
Example 28. Evaluate 6 · (5 − 4) ÷ 2 + 2.
Solution. The grouping symbols force us to do the subtraction ﬁrst. After that, the usual order of
operations is followed.
6 · (5 − 4) ÷ 2 + 2 =
6 · 1 ÷ 2 + 2 =
6 ÷ 2 + 2 =
3 + 2 =
5
Example 29. Evaluate 6 · 5 − 4 ÷ [2 + 2].
Solution. Now the grouping symbols (brackets) force us to do the addition ﬁrst.
6 · 5 − 4 ÷ [2 + 2] =
6 · 5 − 4 ÷ 4 =
30 − 4 ÷ 4 =
30 − 1 =
29
In the next example, there are grouping symbols within grouping symbols. The strategy here is to
work from the inside outward.
Example 30. Evaluate 62 − [3 + (3 − 1)]2.
Page 37
Solution. We have parentheses within brackets. The parentheses enclose up the innermost group, which
is where we start. (That is what “from the inside outward” means.) Thus the ﬁrst operation to be done
is 3 − 1 = 2, yielding
62 − [3 + 2]2.
Next, the bracketed group, [3 + 2] is evaluated, yielding
62 − 52.
At this point, there are no more grouping symbols, and the order of operations tells us to evaluate the
expressions with exponents next, yielding
36 − 25.
All that is left is the remaining subtraction,
36 − 25 = 11.
Example 31. Evaluate
�
(11 − 5)2 + (24 ÷ 2 − 4)2.
Solution. We evaluate the two inner groups (11−5) and (24÷2−4) ﬁrst. In the second group, division
precedes subtraction, yielding 12 − 4 = 8. Thus the expression is reduced to
�
62 + 82.
Next we evaluate the two expressions with exponents, obtaining
√
36 + 64.
Then, remembering that √ is a grouping symbol, we evaluate the group 36 + 64 = 100, and ﬁnally,
evaluate the square root
√
100 = 10.

Average
The average of 2 numbers is their sum, divided by 2. The average of 3 numbers is their sum, divided
by 3. In general, the average of n numbers is their sum, divided by n.
Example 32. Find the average of each of the following multi-sets of numbers. (A multi-set is a set in
which the same number can appear more than once.) (a) {10, 12}; (b) {5, 6, 13}; (c) {8, 12, 9, 7, 14}.
Solution. In each case, we take the sum of all the numbers in the multi-set, and then (following the
order of operations), divide by number of numbers:
(a)
(10 + 12) ÷ 2 = 11;
(b)
(5 + 6 + 13) ÷ 3 = 8;
(c)
(8 + 12 + 9 + 7 + 14) ÷ 5 = 10.
The average of a multi-set of numbers is a description of the whole multi-set, in terms of only one
number. If all the numbers in the multi-set were the same, the average would be that number. For
example, the average of the multi-set {5, 5, 5} is
(5 + 5 + 5) ÷ 3 = 5,
and the average of the multi-set {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2} is
(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2) ÷ 6 = 2.
This gives us another way to deﬁne the average of a multi-set of n numbers: it is that number which,
added to itself n times, gives the same total sum as the sum of all the original numbers in the multi-set.

Perimeter, Area and the Pythagorean Theorem
Squares and rectangles are examples of polygons – closed shapes that can be drawn on a ﬂat surface,
using segments of straight lines which do not cross each other. “Closed” means that the line segments
form a boundary, with no gaps, which encloses a unique “inside” region, and separates it from the
“outside” region.
Example 33. Which of the following ﬁgures are polygons?
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
Solution. (b) is not a polygon since not all of its sides are straight lines. (c) is not a polygon because
it does not have a unique ”inside” region. (d) is not a polygon because it is not closed.
There are two useful numerical quantities associated with a polygon: the perimeter, which is the
length of its boundary, and the area, which is (roughly speaking) the “amount of space” it encloses.
Perimeters are measured using standard units of length such as feet (ft), inches (in) , meters (m),
centimeters (cm). Areas are measured using square units, such as square feet (ft2), square inches
(in2), square meters (m2), square centimeters (cm2).
To ﬁnd the perimeter of a polygon, we simply ﬁnd the sum of the lengths of its sides.
Example 34. Find the perimeter of each polygon. Assume the lengths are measured in feet.

(b)
Solution. Adding the lengths of the sides, we ﬁnd that the perimeter of polygon (a) is
3 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 5 = 18 ft.
Similarly, the perimeter of the polygon (b) is
7 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21 ft.
Page 40
Finding the area of a polygon can be complicated, but it is quite simple if the polygon can be divided
up into rectangles. A rectangle is a four-sided polygon with two pairs of opposite parallel sides, and
“square” corners. The square corners – also known as right angles – imply that the paired opposite
sides have the same length. The length of the shorter pair of sides is often called the width and denoted
w, and the length of the longer pair is called the length and denoted l.
length = l
width = w
l
w
The small squares in the corners are there to indicate that the polygon is a rectangle.
Example 35. Estimate the area of the rectangle below, if the square in the upper left corner is 1 unit
on a side.
length = l
width = w
l
w
1
1
Solution. If the corner square is 1 unit on a side, the area of the rectangle is the number of squares of
that size that ﬁt inside the rectangle. As the next ﬁgure shows, 21 such square units ﬁt inside, in 3 rows
of 7. The width (w) is evidently 3 units, and the length (l) 7 units. The area is the product 3 × 7 = 21
square units.
length = 7
width = 3
7
3
The example illustrates a general fact: the area of a rectangle is the product of the length and
Page 41
the width. If A denotes the area, the formula is
A = l · w.
It is also clear that the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of twice the length and twice the
width, since to travel all the way around the boundary of the rectangle, both the length and the width
must be traversed twice. If P denotes the perimeter, the formula is
P = 2l + 2w.
Example 36. In the ﬁgure below we have drawn an L-shaped polygon on a grid. Find the area and
perimeter of the polygon. Take the unit of area to be one of the large squares of the grid, and assume
these squares are 1 cm on a side.

Solution. Using the grid, it is easy to ﬁnd the lengths of all six sides of the polygon. For example, the
left-hand vertical side is 7 cm long (stretching from 1 to 8 on the scale at left), and the top side is 2
cm long. Continuing clockwise around the L-shape, we see that the side lengths are
7, 2, 5, 4, 2, 6 cm,
respectively. From this, it follows easily that the perimeter P is given by the sum
7 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 6 = 26 cm.
To ﬁnd the area, we draw a line which divides the L-shape into two rectangles (labeled R1 and R2) in
the ﬁgure below. (We could have drawn a diﬀerent line to obtain a diﬀerent division into two rectangles
– do you see it?)
Page 42
R1
R2
7
2

It is evident that R1 has length 7 cm and width 2 cm. So the area of R1 is
A1 = 2 · 7 = 14 cm2.
Similarly, since the length of R2 is 4 cm and the width is 2 cm, the area of R2 is
A2 = 2 · 4 = 8 cm2.
It is visually obvious that the total area A of the L-shaped polygon is the sum A1 + A2 of the areas of
R1 and R2. Thus
A = 14 cm2 + 8 cm2 = 22 cm2.
Using the grid, you can easily verify this result by counting the number of large squares inside the
polygon.
The grid is not necessary, as long as we are given enough side-lengths, and assume square corners.
Example 37. Find the area and perimeter of the right-angled (square-cornered) polygon below. Assume
the side lengths are measured in feet.
Page 43

Solution. There are some missing side lengths (for example, the vertical side on the upper right), but
the area can be determined without them, using subtraction. We can visualize the polygon as a large
rectangle of length 6 ft. and width 5 ft, out of which a rectangular “bite,” of length 3 ft and width 2
ft, has been taken.
6

The area of the large rectangle (bite included) is 6·5 = 30 ft2, and the area of the bite alone is 3·2 = 6
ft2. Thus the area of the original polygon is
30 − 6 = 24 ft2.
To ﬁnd the perimeter, we need the missing side lengths. For the vertical side on the upper right, we
reason as follows. The left edge is 6 ft, and so the total length of all the right vertical edges must also
be 6 ft. The two known vertical edges on the right have lengths 1 and 3, and the unkown edge must
Page 44
make up the diﬀerence. So its length must be
6 − (1 + 3) = 2 ft.
The other missing side (the short horizontal one) is 2 ft.
Adding up all the side lengths, starting
(arbitrarily) with the bottom edge and proceeding counter-clockwise, yields the perimeter:
5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 26 ft.
If we cut a rectangle in two by drawing a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner, we get
two right triangles, each having exactly the same size and shape, and therefore the same area.
Right triangles are interesting in their own right, and we often consider them in isolation, without
reference to the rectangle they came from. The side of a right triangle that is opposite the right angle
(the longest side) is known as the hypotenuse. The two shorter sides are called the legs. In the ﬁgure
below, the legs are labeled a and b, and the hypotenuse is labeled c.
a
b
c
A famous formula, called the Pythagorean theorem, states that, in any right triangle with legs of
length a and b, and hypotenuse of length c, the following relation holds:
a2 + b2 = c2.
We can use this to obtain a formula for the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle in terms of the
lengths of the legs.
c =
�
a2 + b2.
Page 45
Since the area of a right triangle is exactly half the area of the rectangle it came from, it follows
that the area of a right triangle is the product of the lengths of the legs, divided by 2. If A
denotes the area, and the lengths of the legs are a and b as in the ﬁgure, the formula is
A = (a · b) ÷ 2.
Example 38. Find the area and perimeter of a triangle whose legs have length 3 feet and 4 feet.
Solution. Putting a = 4 and b = 3, we ﬁnd the area using the formula
A = (a · b) ÷ 2 = (4 · 3) ÷ 2 = 12 ÷ 2 = 6 ft2.
To ﬁnd the perimeter, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the length of the hypotenuse using the formula

Thus the perimeter is a + b + c = 4 ft +3 ft +5 ft = 12 ft.
Now we can ﬁnd the area and perimeter of any polygon that can be divided up into rectangles and
right triangles.

The rectangle has length 6 cm and width 2 cm, so it has area 6 · 2 = 12 cm2. Both triangles have legs
of length 1 and 2, so the area of each is (2 · 1) ÷ 2 = 1 cm2. Adding the three areas gives the total area
of the polygon: 1 + 12 + 1 = 14 cm2. To ﬁnd the perimeter, we use the Pythagorean theorem to ﬁnd
the lengths of the two slanted sides:

√
5 is between 4 and 6, and it follows that the perimeter is
between 18 and 20 centimeters.

Fractions and Mixed Numbers
Fractions are expressions such as
3
19
or more generally
a
b,
where a and b are whole numbers, and b ̸= 0. The numbers a and b are called terms. The term on top
is called the numerator, and the term on the bottom is called the denominator. The horizontal line
in the middle is called the fraction bar. Sometimes to save space, we write fractions in one line, using
a slash instead of the fraction bar, putting the numerator on the left and the denominator on the right:
a
b = a/b.
When reading a fraction out loud, we attach the suﬃx th or ths to the denominator, saying “a bths”
for a/b.
Example 40. The fractions 1
8 and
6
13 are spoken “one eighth,” and “six thirteenths,” respectively.
If the denominator is 2 or 3, we say “halves” or “thirds” (not twoths or threeths!), respectively. If the
denominator is 4, we sometimes say “fourths,” and sometimes, ”quarters.”
Example 41. 5/2 is spoken “ﬁve halves.” 4/3 is spoken “four thirds.” 3/4 is spoken “three fourths,”
or “three quarters.”
Sometimes, instead of using the th suﬃx, we just say “a over b.” Thus 4/9 can be spoken as “four
ninths,” or just ”four over nine.”
2.1
What fractions mean
Fractions represent parts of a whole in a precise way. In the fraction a/b, the denominator b represents
the number of equal parts into which the whole has been divided, and the numerator represents how
many of those parts are being taken into account. For example, if a rectangle is divided up into 3 equal
parts, and 2 of those parts are shaded, then the shaded portion represents 2
3 (two-thirds) of the whole
rectangle.
49

3
We can divide any convenient ﬁgure into equal parts (not just a rectangle), to represent a fraction. For
example, the circle below has been divided into 5 equal “wedges,” and three of them are shaded. So
the picture represents the fraction 3
5.
Example 42. Use a square to represent the fraction 5/16.
Solution. Since 16 is a perfect square, it’s easy to make a square 4 units on a side, and divide that into
16 small squares of equal size. Then we shade 5 of them (any 5 will do) to represent 5/16.
2.2
Proper and Improper Fractions
A fraction is called proper if its numerator is less than its denominator. A proper fraction represents
less than one whole. An improper fraction has a numerator that is greater than or equal to the
denominator and represents a number that is greater than (or equal to) one whole.
Page 50
Example 43. The ﬁgure below represents three fractions with denominator 9: the ﬁrst one (2/9) is
proper, representing a number less than 1. The other two are improper. The one in the middle (9/9)
represents the whole number 1. The last (10/9) represents a number that is greater than 1.
2
9
9
9 = 1
10
9 = 1 + 1
9
9/9 = 1 illustrates the general fact that the whole number 1 can be represented in inﬁnitely many
ways as a fraction – just take any fraction whose numerator and denominator are equal. For example,
1 = 2
2 = 9
9 = 159
159.
Intuitively, if an object is divided into equal parts, and all the parts are taken, then, in fact, the whole
(1 whole) has been taken.
For any whole number a (except 0),
a
a = 1.
Any whole number can be represented as a fraction. For example, to represent the whole number
3, we can think of three whole rectangles, each “divided” into 1 “part,” and write
3 = 3
1.
More generally,
For any whole number a (including 0),
a = a
1.
2.2.1
Zero as Numerator and Denominator
The whole number 0 can be written as a fraction in inﬁnitely many ways:
0 = 0
b,
for any non-zero b.
Page 51
It is easy to understand why this is true: you can divide something into any number of equal pieces
(say, b of them), but if you take none of them, you have taken an amount equal to 0 – no matter the
value of b. Thus,
0 = 0
1 = 0
2 = 0
3 = ...
So 0 can certainly be the numerator of a fraction. Can it be the denominator? The answer is no.
Here is one way to think about it: does it make sense to divide something into 0 pieces? (1 piece, yes,
but 0 pieces?) A related question is: Can 0 be the divisor in a division problem? If you think so, then
answer this: how many times does 0 go into 7? Thinking back to our original deﬁnition of division as
repeated subtraction, the question is “how many times can 0 be subtracted from 7 before we arrive at a
negative number?” The answer is “as many times as you like!,” since subtracting 0 has no eﬀect on 7,
or any other number. For these reasons we attach no meaning to a fraction with denominator 0, saying,
if it comes up, that it is undeﬁned.
For any whole number n, including 0, the fraction n
0 is un-
deﬁned.
There is another reason why 0 cannot be the denominator of a fraction. Multiplication and division
are mutually inverse operations, meaning that the equation a
b = c is equivalent to the equation a = b ·c
whenever b ̸= 0. Suppose we could assign a numerical value to the fraction 1/0, say, 1
0 = 1. That
would mean that 1 = 0 · 1. But of course, 0 · 1 = 0, so we arrive at 1 = 0, an obvious contradiction.

Mixed Numbers
We have seen that an improper fraction represents either a whole number or a whole number plus a
proper fraction. In the latter form, it is called a mixed number. Even though it is a sum, the + sign
is omitted. Thus
31
2
represents 3 “wholes” plus an extra 1
2.
2.3.1
Converting an improper fraction into a mixed or whole number
Suppose we have an improper fraction
numerator
denominator.
To convert this to a mixed number, we simply perform the division
numerator ÷ denominator,
obtaining a quotient and a remainder. Then we use these to build the mixed number as follows: the
quotient is the whole number part; the remainder over the divisor is the fractional part. Note that the
fractional part obtained in this way is always proper, because the remainder is always smaller than the
divisor. Summarizing:
numerator
denominator = quotientremainder
divisor
Example 44. Write the improper fraction 13/3 as a mixed number.
Solution. Dividing 13 by 3 yields a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 1. The corresponding mixed number
has whole number part 4 and fractional part 1/3. Thus
13
3 = 41
3.
If the remainder is 0, the mixed number is actually just a whole number.
Example 45. Write the improper fraction 84/7 as a mixed number.
Page 53
Solution. Dividing 84 by 7 yields a quotient of 12 and a remainder of 0. Thus
84
7 = 120
7 = 12,
a whole number.
Here are some everyday uses of mixed numbers.
Example 46. Five hikers want to share seven chocolate bars fairly. How many bars does each hiker
get?
Solution. For fairness, each of the ﬁve hikers should get the same amount: exactly one ﬁfth of the
chocolate. There are seven bars, so the amount (in chocolate bars) that each hiker should get is
7
5 = 12
5.
Each hiker gets 12
5 chocolate bars.
Example 47. Julissa waited 5 minutes for the train on Monday, 2 minutes on Tuesday, and then 4, 8,
and 3 minutes on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, respectively. What was her average wait time for
the week?
Solution. Recall that the average of a set of numbers is their sum, divided by the number of numbers.
In this case, we want the average of the ﬁve numbers {5, 2, 4, 8, 3}, which is
5 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 3
5
= 22
5 = 42
5.
Her average wait time was 42
5 minutes. (Extra credit: how long is two ﬁfths of a minute, in seconds?)

Page 54
2.3.3
Converting a mixed or whole number to an improper fraction
Sometimes we need to change a mixed number back into an improper fraction. The key fact, again, is
that the fraction
a
a
is always equal to 1, for any number a except 0. For example,
3
3 = 1.
Example 48. Convert the mixed number 21
3 to an improper fraction, using the fact that 3
3 = 1.
Solution. Think of the whole number 2 in the following way:
2 = 1 + 1 = 3
3 + 3
3.
It follows that the mixed number 21
3 can be written
3
3 + 3
3 + 1

(The ﬁgure also demonstrates that fractions with the same denominator add up to a new fraction, with
the same denominator, and a numerator which is the sum of all the old numerators. We’ll say more
about adding fractions later. )
The procedure in the previous example is easily turned into a general formula.
The mixed number N p
q is equal to the improper fraction N · q + p
q
.
Remember to follow the order of operations (multiplication before addition) when evaluating N · q + p.
Example 49. Convert the mixed number 82
3 into an improper fraction, using the boxed rule.

3 = 8 · 3 + 2

Solution. We can think of the whole number 8 as the “mixed” number 80
q for any nonzero q. By the
boxed rule,
8 = 8 · q + 0
q
= 8 · q
q .
Picking three nonzero numbers for q, say, 2, 5 and 10, we get

Multiplication of Fractions
Fractions are numbers in their own right, and we will recall how to add, subtract, multiply and divide
them. We begin with multiplication, since it is one of the easiest operations to perform.
We understand what it means to take, let’s say, a third of something: divide it into three pieces,
and take one of the pieces. Similarly, to take three-fourths of something, divide it into four pieces, and
take three of them. What if the “something” is itself a fraction? For example, what is three fourths of
2
3? It is some fraction, but which one?
We’ll try to make sense of this question by representing fractions as shaded portions of rectangles.
Represent the fraction 2
3 using a rectangle divided into 3 equal vertical parts, with 2 of them shaded.
Divide the same rectangle into 4 equal horizontal parts, and shade 3 of them (using a diﬀerent shading).
The double-shaded portion represents the desired fraction, 3
4 of 2
3. By counting, you can see that it
consists of 6 out of 12 smaller rectangles.

Solution. Start with a rectangle divided into 3 equal vertical parts, and shade one of the parts, to
represent the fraction 1/3. Then divide the whole rectangle horizontally into 2 equal parts, and shade
one of the horizontal parts using a diﬀerent shading. The rectangle is now cut into 2·3 = 6 equal parts,
and the two shadings overlap in precisely 1 of the 6 parts.

6.
The two examples illustrate a simple rule for ﬁnding a “fraction of a fraction,” or a
b of c
d . The new
denominator is the product of the denominators of the two original fractions, since dividing a rectangle
into b vertical parts and also d horizontal parts results in b · d smaller rectangular parts. Each of the
Page 57
a shaded vertical rectangles is divided into d parts of which c are diﬀerently shaded. Hence there are
a · c doubly shaded smaller rectangles, so that a · c is the new numerator. The rule is
a
b
of
c
d
=
a · c
b · d .
We use this rule to deﬁne multiplication of fractions, replacing “of” by the multiplication symbol · (or
×):
a
b · c
d = a · c
b · d
In words: The product of two fractions is the product of the numerators over the product of the
denominators.
Example 52. Find the product 3
8 · 5
7.
Solution. Using the boxed rule,
3
8 · 5
7 = 3 · 5
8 · 7 = 15
56.
It is easy to see that fraction multiplication is just an expanded version of whole number multipli-
cation, since every whole number is a fraction with denominator 1. Thus the boxed rule applies when
one (or both!) of the multiplicands is a whole number.
Example 53. What is two thirds of ﬁve? That is, ﬁnd the product 2
3 · 5.
Solution. Writing 5 as the fraction 5/1 and using the fraction multiplication rule, we get
2
3 · 5
1 = 2 · 5
3 · 1 = 10
3 .
Example 54. One third of a twelve-member jury are women. How many women are on the jury?
Solution. One third of twelve equals 1
3 · 12
1 = 12
3 = 4. There are four women on the jury.
You may have noticed that in our very ﬁrst example with rectangles,
3
4 · 2
3 = 6
12,
exactly half of the rectangle ends up doubly-shaded (6 is half of 12). So it is correct (and simpler) to
say that
3
4 · 2
3 = 1
2.
Does this contradict our rule? No, because 1/2 and 6/12 represent the same number. We’ll explain
this, and examine some other technical details regarding the representation of fractions, in the next
sections. Then we’ll continue with the arithmetic (division, addition, subtraction) of fractions.

Equivalent Fractions
Fractions which look very diﬀerent can represent the same number. For example, the fractions
2
4,
5
10,
6
12, and 50
100
all represent the number 1
2. What property do all these fractions share? Each has a denominator that
is exactly twice its numerator; the simplest fraction with this property is 1
2.
Fractions which represent the same number are called equivalent, and we use the equal sign to
indicate this. Thus, for example,
1
2 = 50
100.
There is an easy way to tell when two fractions are equivalent. We give it here because it is so simple
and pleasing, but we postpone the explanation until we discuss proportions.
a
b = c
d
if (and only if)
a · d = b · c.
In words: two fractions are equivalent if (and only if) their cross-products are equal. A cross-product is
the product of the numerator of one fraction and the denominator of the other.
Starting with a given fraction, we can generate equivalent fractions easily, using the fact that 1 is
the multiplicative identity, and that
1 = c
c
for any non-zero c. Then
a
b = a
b · 1 = a
b · c
c ,
and so we have
Page 59
The Fundamental Property of Fractions:
If we multiply both the numerator and denominator of a fraction by any nonzero
c, then the new fraction is equivalent to the original one, and represents the same
number:
a
b = a · c
b · c .
Example 55. Write two fractions equivalent to 2
3.
Solution. We use the fact that
2
3 = 2 · c
3 · c
for any nonzero c. Picking two values for c, say, 6 and 7, we get two fractions equivalent to 2/3:
2
3 = 2 · 6
3 · 6 = 12
18
and
2
3 = 2 · 7
3 · 7 = 14
21.
Of course, other choices of c would have produced other fractions equivalent to 2/3.
2.5.1
Cancellation and Lowest Terms
The boxed rule above produces equivalent fractions with higher (larger) terms. It is sometimes possible
to go the other way, producing lower (smaller) terms.
If both numerator and denominator have a
common factor – a whole number greater than 1 which divides them both with zero remainder – we
can “cancel” it by division. The two quotients become the terms of an equivalent fraction with lower
terms. For example, the numerator and denominator of 18
24 have the common factor 6. Thus
18
24 = 18 ÷ 6
24 ÷ 6 = 3
4.
In general,
For any non-zero c,
a
b = a ÷ c
b ÷ c .
This method of obtaining lower terms is called cancellation or cancelling out. It is often indicated as
follows:
18
24 = 
>3
18

>4
24
= 3
4.
This is useful short-hand, but it has one disadvantage: the common factor (6, in this case) is not made
visible. To ensure accuracy, you can show the common factor explicitly, before cancelling it. Thus,
explicitly,
18
24 = 3 · 6
4 · 6 = 3 · ��6
4 · ��6
= 3
4.
Page 60
Example 56. Find lower terms for the fraction 28
70.
Solution. Since 7 is a common factor of the numerator and denominator, it can be cancelled, yielding

>4
28

>10
70
= 4
10
(cancelling 7).
Still lower terms are possible, since 4 and 10 have the common factor 2:

>2
4

>5
10
= 2
5
(cancelling 2).
If the only common factor of the numerator and denominator is 1, then no further reduction is
possible, and the fraction is said to be in lowest terms. For example, 2 and 5 have no common factor
other than 1, so the fraction 2
5, and also the improper 5
2, are in lowest terms.
Example 57. Reduce the fraction 24
36 to lowest terms.
Solution. A common factor of the numerator and denominator is 4, so we can reduce the terms as
follows:
24
36 = 
>6
24

>9
36
= 6
9
(cancelling 4);
6 and 9 have the common factor 3, so we can further reduce
6
9 = ��
2
6
��
3
9
= 2
3
(cancelling 3).
It is clear that 2
3 is in lowest terms, since 2 and 3 have no common factor other than 1.
Note that this reduction to lowest terms could have been accomplished in one step, had we realized,
at the outset, that both 24 and 36 are divisible by 12:
24
36 = 
>2
24

>3
36
= 2
3
(cancelling 12).
Example 58. Reduce the fraction 13
39 to lowest terms.

13
39 = 1 · 13
3 · 13 = 1

Prime Factorization and the GCF
Reducing a fraction to lowest terms requires recognizing a common factor (greater than 1) of the
numerator and denominator. Doing it in one step requires ﬁnding and using the largest or greatest
common factor. In this section, we develop a systematic way of ﬁnding the greatest common factor
(GCF) of a set of numbers.
A whole number greater than 1 is prime if it has no factors other than itself and 1. The ﬁrst few
prime numbers are
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ... .
The dots indicate that there are inﬁnitely many larger primes. (This fact is not obvious but was proved
more than two thousand years ago by Euclid.) The whole numbers greater than 1 which are not prime
Page 62
are called composite. (Note that 1 is a special case according to these deﬁnitions: it is neither prime
nor composite!) The ﬁrst few composite numbers are
4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, ...
How do we know that these numbers are composite? Because each has at least one factor, other than
1 and itself. For example, 15 has factors 3 and 5, that is, 15 = 3 · 5.
Every composite whole number has a unique prime factorization, which is its expression as the
product of its prime factors, listed in order of increasing size. For example:
4 = 2 · 2
= 22
6 = 2 · 3
8 = 2 · 2 · 2
= 23
9 = 3 · 3
= 32
10 = 2 · 5
12 = 2 · 2 · 3
= 22 · 3
14 = 2 · 7
15 = 3 · 5
16 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 2
= 24
(2.1)
To ﬁnd prime factorizations, we use repeated division with prime divisors.
Start by testing the
number for divisibility by the smallest prime, 2 (a number is divisible by 2 if its ﬁnal digit is even:
0, 2, 4, 6 or 8). If it is divisible by 2, we divide by 2 as many times as possible, until we arrive at a
quotient which is no longer divisible by 2. We then repeat the procedure, starting with the last quotient
obtained, and using the next larger prime, 3 (a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible
by 3 – did you know that?). Repeating again (if necessary) with the next larger prime, we eventually
arrive at a quotient which is itself a prime number. At that point, we are almost ﬁnished. We collect
all the primes that were used as divisors (if the same prime has been used more than once, it should be
collected as many times), together with the ﬁnal (prime) quotient. The product of all these numbers is
the prime factorization.
Example 60. Find the prime factorization of 300.
Solution. 300, being even, is divisible by 2, so we start by dividing by 2. The steps are as follows:
300 ÷ 2 = 150;
150 ÷ 2 = 75;
75 is not divisible by 2; move on to 3
75 ÷ 3 = 25;
25 is not divisible by 3; move on to 5
25 ÷ 5 = 5;
5 is a prime number; stop.
The primes that were used as divisors were 2, 2, 3, 5. Note that 2 was used twice, so it is listed twice.
The ﬁnal prime quotient is 5. The prime factorization is the product of all those prime divisors and the
ﬁnal prime quotient:
300 = 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 · 5
or
22 · 3 · 52.
We can easily check our work by multiplying the prime factors and verifying that the product obtained
is the original number.

Finding the GCF
Using prime factorizations, it is easy to ﬁnd the greatest common factor of a set of numbers.
Example 61. Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two-number set {a, b}, where a and b
have the following prime factorizations.
a = 24 · 32 · 7
and
b = 2 · 34 · 11.
Solution. First, look for the common prime factors of a and b: they are 2 and 3. Note that 7 and 11
are not common, and therefore cannot be factors of the GCF. Now look at the powers (exponents) on
2 and 3. A small power of any prime is a factor of any larger power of the same prime. The smallest
power of 2 that appears is 2 = 21 (in the factorization of b), and the smallest power of 3 that appears
is 32 (in the factorization of a). It follows that the GCF is the product of the two smallest powers of 2
and 3. Thus
GCF{a, b} = 21 · 32 = 18.
Notice that the actual values of a and b (which we could have determined by multiplication) were not
used – only their prime factorizations.
Here is a summary of the procedure:
To ﬁnd the GCF of a set of numbers:
1. ﬁnd the prime factorization of each number;
2. determine the prime factors common to all the numbers;
3. if there are no common prime factors, the GCF is 1; otherwise
4. for each common prime factor, ﬁnd the smallest exponent that appears on
it;
5. the GCF is the product of the common prime factors with the exponents
found in step 4.
Page 64
Example 62. (a) Find the GCF of the set {60, 135, 150}. (b) Find the GCF of the subset {60, 150}.
Solution. (a) Following the boxed procedure:
1. the prime factorizations are
60 = 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 = 22 · 3 · 5
135 = 3 · 3 · 3 · 5 = 33 · 5
150 = 2 · 3 · 5 · 5 = 2 · 3 · 52
2. the common prime factors are 3 and 5;
3. (does not apply to this example);
4. the smallest exponent on 3 is 1 (in the factorizations of 60 and 150); the smallest exponent on 5
is also 1 (in the factorizations of 60 and 135);
5. the GCF is 31 · 51 = 15.
(b) For the two-number subset {60, 150}, the common prime factors are 2, 3 and 5. The smallest
exponent on all three factors is 1. So the GCF is 21 · 31 · 51 = 30.
Can you explain why the GCF in part (b) is bigger than in part (a)?

2.6.4
Cancelling the GCF for lowest terms
Knowing that the GCF of {60, 150} = 30 allows us to reduce the fraction
60
150 to lowest terms in one
step: we simply cancel it out. Thus,
60
150 = ��
* 2
60
��
�
* 5
150
= 2

(cancelling the GCF, 30).
Recall that this is short-hand for
60 ÷ 30
150 ÷ 30 = 2

Page 65
Example 63. Reduce 168
252 to lowest terms by ﬁnding and cancelling the GCF.
Solution. The prime factorizations of the numerator and denominator are
168 = 23 · 3 · 7
252 = 22 · 32 · 7.
The smallest exponent on 2 is 2, and the smallest exponents on 3 and 7 are 1; it follows that the GCF
is 22 · 3 · 7 = 84. Cancelling the GCF yields lowest terms:
168
252 = ��

Pre-cancelling when Multiplying Fractions
In the fraction product
21
5 · 15
14,
we could simply follow the rule that the product of fractions is the product of the numerators over the
product of the denominators,
21 · 15
5 · 14 ,
calculate the products in the numerator and denominator and, ﬁnally, reduce the resulting fraction to
lowest terms by cancelling out the GCF. But there’s a short-cut: Since multiplication is commutative,
we can reverse the order of multiplication in the numerator, obtaining
15 · 21
5 · 14 = 15
5 · 21
14.
The fractions on the right-hand side are easily reduced to lowest terms by cancelling the obvious GCFs
(5 and 7, respectively)

leaving a simpler product
3

2,
which has the further advantage that the solution, 9
2, is already in lowest terms. The trick of cancelling
before multiplying – pre-cancellation – saves us from bigger numbers,
21

14 = 315

and the extra work of ﬁnding the GCF{315, 70} = 35 for cancellation:
��
�

315

(cancelling 35),
The general rule is this:
In a product of fractions, a factor which is common to one
of the numerators and one of the denominators can be can-
celled before multiplying. The numerator and denominator
need not belong to the same fraction.
Notice that pre-cancellation works with any number of factors.
Example 64. Find the product
3

No further cancellation is possible. The ﬁnal answer is now a simple product

3,
which is already in lowest terms. These cancellations could have been done in a diﬀerent order, or
(carefully) all at once.
Mixed numbers are multiplied by simply converting them into improper fractions.
Example 65. Find the product 23

Adding and Subtracting Fractions
If I eat a third of a pizza for lunch, and another third for dinner, then I have eaten two thirds in total.
That is,
1
3 + 1
3 = 2
3.
Similar logic applies whenever we add two (or more) fractions with the same denominator – we simply
add the numerators, while keeping the denominator ﬁxed:
a
c + b
c = a + b
c
.
A very similar rule holds for subtraction of fractions with the same denominator:
Page 69
a
c − b
c = a − b
c
.
Fractions with the same denominator are called like fractions.
Example 67. Here are three examples involving addition or subtraction of like fractions:

5 + 2
5 = 1 + 2

Adding and Subtracting Unlike Fractions
Here is the rule for adding any two fractions, like or unlike:
a
b + c
d = ad + bc
bd
Compared to the rule for multiplying fractions (Section 2.4), it looks a bit strange. But it is easily
proved, using (yet again) the fact that 1 = b/b and 1 = d/d, for any nonzero b or d.
a
b + c
d = a
b · d
d + c
d · b
b
= ad
bd + bc
bd
= ad + bc
bd
Example 68. Add 2
5 + 3
7.
Solution. Using the boxed rule,
2
5 + 3
7 = 2 · 7 + 5 · 3
5 · 7
= 14 + 15
35
= 19
35.
Example 69. Add 15
16 + 19
24.
Solution. Using the boxed rule,
15
16 + 19
24 = 15 · 24 + 16 · 19
16 · 24
= 664
384.
Cancelling the GCF, 8, we obtain the sum in lowest terms, 83
48.
The rule works for like fractions too:
Example 70. Use the boxed rule to show that 4
5 + 3
5 = 7
5.
Solution.
4
5 + 3
5 = 20 + 15
25
= 35
25 = 7
5.
Note that an extra factor of 5 was introduced, and then cancelled at the end. (A needless complication!)
Page 71
A disadvantage of the boxed is that it produces a fraction which may be far from lowest terms.
Another disadvantage is that it doesn’t extend easily to sums of more than two fractions. To remedy
these, we develop a method, somewhat analogous to pre-cancellation in multiplication, which produces
the sum of any set of fractions in a form which is as close as possible to lowest terms. The idea is to
replace each fraction by an equivalent fraction, each having the same (common) denominator, which is
as small as possible.
Example 71. Find the sum:
2
3 + 1
5.
Solution. Observe that
2
3 = 2 · 5
3 · 5 = 10
15
and
1
5 = 1 · 3
5 · 3 = 3
15.
It follows that
2
3 + 1
5 = 10
15 + 3
15.
Now we have like fractions, and so
10
15 + 3
15 = 10 + 3
15
= 13
15.
Since equivalent fractions represent the same number, we conclude that
2
3 + 1
5 = 13
15.
Why (and how) did we choose 15 as the common denominator? And how do we know it is the
smallest common denominator we could have used? We could have chosen any number that is a multiple
of both 3 and 5 (the two original denominators in the example). The multiples of 3 are
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, etc.,
and the multiples of 5 are
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, etc.,
and it is easy to see that the smallest number that is a multiple of both – the least common multiple –
is 15.
2.8.3
The LCM
The method of listing small multiples is often the simplest way to ﬁnd the least common multiple, or
LCM, of a set of whole numbers.
Example 72. Find the LCM{6, 10, 15}.
Solution. The multiples of 6 are
6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ... ,
the multiples of 10 are
10, 20, 30, 40, ... ,
and the multiples of 15 are
15, 30, 45, ... .
It is evident that the smallest number which is a multiple of all three numbers is 30.
Page 72
The LCM can also be found using prime factorizations. This is useful when the numbers are rather
large.
Example 73. Find the LCM of the two-number set {a, b}, where a and b have the following prime
factorizations.
a = 24 · 32 · 7
and
b = 2 · 34 · 11.
Solution. The LCM must be a multiple of both numbers, so that it must be divisible by the highest
power of every prime factor that appears in any one of the factorizations. The prime factors of a and b
are 2, 3, 7 and 11. The highest powers that appear are
24,
34,
71,
111.
The LCM is the product of these powers:
LCM{a, b} = 24 · 34 · 7 · 11.
This is a rather large number, but it is the smallest which is a multiple of both a and b. Notice that the
actual values of a and b, and their LCM (which we could calculate by multiplication) were not needed
– only their prime factorizations.
Here is a summary of the procedure:
To ﬁnd the LCM of a set of numbers:
1. ﬁnd the prime factorization of each number;
2. for each prime factor, ﬁnd the largest exponent that appears on it in any of
the factorizations;
3. the LCM is the product of the prime factors with the exponents found in
step 2.
Compare this procedure with the procedure for ﬁnding the GCF of a set of numbers. There are similarities
and signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

2.8.5
The LCD
To add unlike fractions so that the sum is in lowest terms, we use the LCM of their denominators.
This is such a frequent operation with fractions that it has its own name: the LCD or Least Common
Denominator.
Example 74. Find the LCD of the fractions
1
8,
3
10,
and
1
18.
Solution. The LCD of the fractions is the LCM of their denominators,
LCM{8, 10, 18}.
Looking at the prime factorizations
8 = 23,
10 = 2 · 5,
18 = 2 · 32,
and taking the highest power of each prime that occurs, we see that the LCM is
23 · 32 · 5 = 360.
This is LCD of the fractions.
Example 75. Find the sum of the unlike fractions 1
8 + 3
10 + 1
18.
Solution. The LCD is the LCM from the previous example: 360. Now we observe that
360
=
8 · 45
=
10 · 36
=
18 · 20.
Thus
1
8 = 1 · 45
8 · 45,
3
10 = 3 · 36
10 · 36
and
1
18 = 1 · 20
18 · 20.
It follows that
1
8 + 3
10 + 1
18 = 1 · 45
8 · 45 + 3 · 36
10 · 36 + 1 · 20
18 · 20
(2.2)
= 45 + 108 + 20
360
= 173
360.
Since the 173 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, the fraction is in lowest terms.
Page 74
Practically the same method works for subtracting unlike fractions.
Example 76. Find the diﬀerence 14
25 − 2
10, using the LCD. Reduce to lowest terms, if necessary.
Solution. The LCD is LCM{25, 10} = 50. Now 50 = 25 · 2 = 10 · 5. So
14
25 = 14 · 2
25 · 2 = 28
50,
and
2
10 = 2 · 5
10 · 5 = 10
50.
Thus, the diﬀerence of the two fractions is
28
50 − 10
50 = 28 − 10
50
= 18
50.
The latter fraction is not in lowest terms, since the GCF of 18 and 50 is 2. Cancelling the GCF, we get
18
50 = 
>9
18

>25
50
= 9
25.
Example 77. Subtract 1
3 − 1
4, and reduce to lowest terms if necessary.
Solution. The LCD is 12. Changing both fractions to equivalent fractions with denominator 12, we get
1
3 = 1 · 4
3 · 4 = 4
12
and
1
4 = 1 · 3
4 · 3 = 3
12.
Thus,
1
3 − 1
4 = 4
12 − 3
12 = 4 − 3
12
= 1
12.
The latter fraction is already in lowest terms, so we are done.
Example 78. Find the sum 4
5 + 3
4, reduce to lowest terms, and express the answer as a mixed number.
Solution. The LCD{4, 5} = 20, so that
4
5 + 3
4 = 4 · 4
5 · 4 + 3 · 5
4 · 5 = 16
20 + 15
20 = 31
20 = 111

Comparison of Fractions
When two fractions have the same denominator, it is clear that the larger fraction is the one with the
larger numerator. This suggests a simple way to compare any set of fractions: replace each fraction by
an equivalent fraction having the LCD. Then the largest fraction is the one with the largest numerator,
the second-largest is the one with the second-largest numerator, etc.
Example 79. Which is larger, 2
3 or 3
4?
Solution. The LCD is 12,
2
3 = 8
12,
and
3
4 = 9
12.
The larger of the two fractions with denominator 12 is the one with the larger numerator,
9
12. It follows
that 3
4 is larger than 2
3.
The inequality symbols < (less than) and > (greater than) are used to state size comparisons
between numbers. For example, the inequalities
1
2 < 1,
21
3 > 2
state that 1
2 is less than 1, and that 21
3 is greater than 2. Visualizing the number line yields a good rule

It is a happy coincidence that the symbol < for “Less than” looks rather like the letter “L.”
Numbers arranged in increasing order are written from left to right, separated by the < symbol.
(This is the left-to-right ordering on the number line.) We can also arrange numbers in decreasing
order, from left to right, separated by the > (“greater than”) symbol.
Example 80. Arrange the fractions 3
4, 2
3, and 7
9 in increasing order.
Solution. LCD{3, 4, 9} = 36, and
3
4 = 27
36
2
3 = 24
36
7
9 = 28
36.
We are asked to arrange the fractions in increasing order, so we list them in increasing order of their
numerators, separated by the inequality symbol <. Thus,
24
36 < 27
36 < 28
36.
Now, going back to the equivalent fractions in lowest terms, we have
2
3 < 3
4 < 7
9.
Example 81. Arrange the numbers 13
5, 13
4, 16
7, and 11
12 in decreasing order.
Solution. Recall that a proper fraction is less than 1, so 11
12 is obviously the smallest of the four numbers
(the others being mixed numbers greater than 1). To compare the other three numbers, it is enough to
compare their fractional parts, because each has the same whole number part (1). To compare 3
5, 3
4,
and 6
7, we ﬁnd the LCM{5, 4, 7} = 140, and write equivalent fractions with denominator 140:
3
5 = 84
140
3
4 = 105
140
6
7 = 120
140.
In decreasing order, the numerators are 120 > 105 > 84. The corresponding ordering of the fractions is
6
7 > 3
4 > 3
5,
Page 77
and it follows that the corresponding order of the mixed numbers (each with whole number part 1) is
16
7 > 13
4 > 13
5.
Adjoining the smallest (proper) fraction 11
12 at the end, we have, ﬁnally, the decreasing order
16
7 > 13
4 > 13
5 > 11
12.

Division of Fractions
Our intuition is not very good when we think of dividing two fractions. How many times does 2
3 “go
into” 3
4, for example? Equivalently, what fraction results from the division problem
3
4 ÷ 2
3?
It is not at all obvious. We will derive a simple rule, but we’ll need an auxiliary concept.
2.10.1
Reciprocals
Two non-zero numbers are reciprocal if their product is 1. Thus, if x and y are nonzero numbers, and
if
x · y = 1,
then x is the reciprocal of y, and, also, y is the reciprocal of x.
The rule for multiplying fractions, together with obvious cancellations, shows that
a
b · b
a = �

1
a · b
b · �

1
a
= 1 · 
>1
b

>1
b · 1
= 1
1 = 1.
This means that
Page 78
The reciprocal of the fraction a
b is the fraction b
a.
(both a and b nonzero)
Since every whole number n can be written as the fraction n
1, we have the following special case:
The reciprocal of the whole number n (nonzero)
is the fraction 1
n.
Example 82. The reciprocal of 5 is 1
5. The reciprocal of 1
9 is 9. The reciprocal of 3
8 is 8
3, or, expressed
as a mixed number, 22
3.
We note some important facts and special cases:
• the reciprocal of the reciprocal of a number is the number itself. For example, the reciprocal of
2/3 is 3/2, and in turn, the reciprocal of 3/2 is 2/3.
• 1 is the only (positive) number that is its own reciprocal (since 1 = 1
1.)
• the reciprocal of a number less than 1 is a number greater than 1, and vice versa (since the
reciprocal of a proper fraction is an improper fraction).
• 0 has no reciprocal (since division by 0 is undeﬁned).

Division is Multiplication by the Reciprocal of the Divisor
Consider again the division problem
3
4 ÷ 2
3.
Using the LCD, this is equivalent to
9
12 ÷ 8
12
Page 79
We want to know how many times 8 things of a certain size (1/12) go into 9 things of the same size.
The actual denominator doesn’t really matter, only that it is the same for both fractions. In this form
it seems obvious that the answer is the quotient of the numerators, 9
8.
Now, how were the numbers 9 and 8 obtained from the original fractions? Well, in writing equivalent
fractions with the LCD, we computed the numerators as follows: 9 = 3 · 3 and 8 = 4 · 2. We have
shown that
3
4 ÷ 2
3 = 3 · 3
4 · 2 = 3
4 · 3
2.
The original division turned into multiplication by the reciprocal of the divisor, and the LCD wasn’t
actually needed.
We have derived a simple rule:
a
b ÷ c
d = a
b · d
c
In words: the quotient of two fractions is the product of the dividend and the reciprocal of the divisor.
Example 83. Perform the division
5

We can divide mixed numbers, too, by simply converting them into improper fractions ﬁrst.
Example 85. Perform the division 28
9 ÷ 11
2. Express the result as a mixed number.
Solution. Converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, we have
28
9 ÷ 11
2 = 26
9 ÷ 3
2.
Page 80
Now we convert the division into multiplication by the reciprocal of 3
2:
= 26
9 · 2
3.
No pre-cancellation is possible, so
26 · 2
9 · 3 = 52
27 = 125
27,
where, at the last step, we converted the improper fraction into a mixed number.
Example 86. How many books, each 13
4 inch thick, can ﬁt on a 35 inch bookshelf?
Solution. The question calls for division, since we need to know how many times 13
4 “goes into” 35.
35 ÷ 13
4 = 35
1 ÷ 7
4 = 35
1 · 4
7.
Cancelling 7, we get
5
1 · 4
1 = 20
1 = 20.
So, exactly 20 books will ﬁt on the shelf.

Mixed Numbers and Mixed Units
Mixed numbers can be added and subtracted by ﬁrst converting them into improper fractions, and very
often this is what we do. But a problem such as
751
2 + 593
4
is not well-suited to this method. If we convert to improper fractions, the numerators of both fractions
would be quite large and unwieldy.
2.11.1
Vertical Addition and Subtraction
We can align mixed numbers vertically so that the fractional and whole number parts line-up, and
then separately add the fraction and whole number columns. We must ensure that the resulting mixed
number is in proper form (the fractional part must be a proper fraction), and this involves a procedure
analogous to “carrying” in whole number addition.
Example 87. Add 21
2 + 63
4.
Solution. We ﬁrst align the whole number and fractional places vertically:
2
1
2
+
6
3
4
To add the fractional parts, we write them both with their LCD, which is 4.
2
2
4
+
6
3
4
Then we add the columns separately.
2
2
4
+
6
3
4
8
5
4
The resulting mixed number, 85
4, is not in proper form, because 5
4 = 11
4. So we leave the proper fractional
part, 1
4, in the fractions column, and carry the whole number part, 1, over to the whole number column.
(We indicate the carrying by writing {1} above the whole number column.) Then we recompute the
Page 82
whole number sum, obtaining the ﬁnal answer in proper form:
{1}
2
2
4
+
6
3
4

To subtract mixed numbers, we sometimes need a “borrowing” procedure, analogous to the proce-
dure we use when subtracting whole numbers.
Example 88. Subtract 7 − 32
5.
Solution. Note that the whole number 7 is a mixed number with 0 fractional part, and we can represent
0 as a fraction using any convenient denominator. Here the convenient choice is 5. So we write 7 = 70
5.
Aligning whole number parts vertically, we have
7
0
5
−
3
2
5
Now we see that the subtraction in the fractions place is not possible (we can’t take 2 ﬁfths from 0
ﬁfths), so we need to borrow 1 from the whole numbers column. 1 = n
n for any convenient n (except
0), and in this example, it is convenient to write 1 = 5
5. Borrowing 1 = 5
5 from 7 (reducing it to 6),
and adding 1 = 5
5 to 0
5 at the top of the fractions column, we have
6
5
5
−
3
2
5
3

5
Both of the previous examples could have been done by ﬁrst converting the mixed numbers into
improper fractions. For example,
7 − 32
5 = 35
5 − 17
5 = 18
5 = 33
5.
Perhaps you ﬁnd this easier. But here is an example that would involve much more work if we were to
use that method.
Example 89. Subtract 153 2
15 − 674
9.
Page 83
Solution. The LCD{15, 9} = 45, and since
2
15 = 6
45 and 4
9 = 20
45, we write, in vertical form,
153
6
45
−
67
20
45
The subtraction in the fractions column is not possible, so we borrow 1 from 153 (in the form 45
45) and
add it to
6
45, obtaining
152
51
45
−
67
20
45
Now the subtraction in the fractions column is possible, and we obtain
152
51
45
−
67
20
45
85
31
45
The fractional part is in lowest terms, and we are done.
If we had done the previous example by ﬁrst converting the mixed numbers into improper fractions, we
would have had to work with rather large numerators:
6891
45
− 3035
45
Not impossible, but the other method is easier!

Measurements in Mixed Units
When a number results from a measurement, it is given in terms of a unit of measure, or unit for short.
For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a table, the length is given in units of
feet (ft). All 1-foot rulers are divided into 12 smaller units called inches (in), so that
1 ft = 12 in.
More precise measurements can be given in terms of the mixed units feet-and-inches. For example,
the length of your table might be 3 feet 6 inches or 3 ft 6 in.
Other familiar examples of mixed units are hours-and-minutes, or hours-minutes-and-seconds. The
abbreviations are hr, min and sec. Of course,
1 hr = 60 min
and
1 min = 60 sec.
Mixed units are just like mixed numbers, because the smaller units are simple fractions of the larger
ones:
1 in = 1
12 ft
1 min = 1
60 hr
1 sec = 1
60 min.
It follows that measurements in mixed units can be added and subtracted just like mixed numbers. The
notion of proper form remains since, for example, a measurement of
4 ft 17 in
makes sense, but is properly written as
5 ft 5 in,
since any measurement of over 12 inches is at least 1 foot. Borrowing and carrying are sometimes
needed, and are easily accomplished, as the next example shows.
Page 85
Example 90. Hugo and Hector go to separate movies that start at the same time. Hugo’s movie is 2
hours and 5 minutes long, while Hector’s is 1 hour and 43 minutes. How long will Hector have to wait,
after his movie is over, for Hugo to come out?
Solution. Hector’s waiting time is the diﬀerence in the lengths of the movies,
2 hr
5 min
−
1 hr
43 min
The subtraction in the minutes column can’t be done, so we borrow 1 hr = 60 min from the hours
column, reducing the number of hours at the top of the hours column from 2 to 1, and increasing the
number of minutes at the top of the minutes column from 5 min to 5 min + 60 min = 65 min.
1 hr
65 min
−
1 hr
43 min
0 hr
22 min
Hector will have to wait 22 minutes.
Here’s an example involving length measurements.
Example 91. Two boards are laid end-to-end. One of the boards measures 6 ft 8 in, and the other
measures 11 ft 10 in. What is the total length of the boards? Give your answer in proper form.
Solution. We need to calculate the mixed-unit sum
6 ft
8 in
+
11 ft
10 in
Adding the inches column, we obtain 18 in = 1 ft 6 in. So we put down 6 in in the inches column, and
carry 1 ft to the top of the feet column:
{1 ft}
6 ft
8 in
+
11 ft
10 in
6 in
We add up the feet column to obtain the ﬁnal answer:
{1 ft}
6 ft
8 in
+
11 ft
10 in
18 ft
6 in
The total length, in proper form, is 18 ft 6 in.

Combined operations with fractions and mixed numbers
Recall that when there is more than one operation to be performed in a calculation, we agree to follow
the order of operations:
1. operations within grouping symbols ﬁrst;
2. exponents and roots next;
3. multiplications and divisions (in order of appearance) next;
4. additions and subtractions (in order of appearance) last.
We remind you that “in order of appearance” means in order from left to right, and that “grouping sym-
bols” include parentheses, brackets, braces (curly brackets), the square root symbol, and the horizontal
fraction line as in a+b
c−d .

Chapter 3
Decimals and Percents
Decimals are mixed numbers in which the proper fractional part has a denominator which is 10, or 100,
or 1000, or, more generally, a power of 10. Here are some powers of 10:
100 = 1
101 = 10
102 = 100
103 = 1000
104 = 10000
10n = 1 followed by n 0’s.
The number above and to the right of 10 is the exponent, or power, and indicates the number of times
that 10 appears as a factor. Thus
103 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000,
and so forth.
Here are some examples of mixed numbers in which the denominator of the fractional part is a power
of ten, together with their representations as decimals:
1 3
10
=
1.3
21 37
100
=
21.37
13 21
1000
=
13.021
The decimal point (which looks like the period at the end of a sentence) separates the whole number
part from the proper fractional part. The digits to the right of the decimal point represent the fractional
part according to the following rule:
• the digits to the right of the decimal point constitute the numerator;
• the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is the power of 10 which constitutes the
denominator.
91
There is no need to show the fraction bar. As we shall see, this makes computation very easy. There
are some subtleties to watch out for, however. In the example
13 21
1000
=
13.021,
we had to use 021 to represent the numerator 21 because we need three digits to show that the
denominator is 103.
3.1
Decimal place values
In Chapter 1 we showed that any whole number can be written using just the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, by using the place value system. Thus, you will recall that
4267 stands for
4 thousands + 2 hundreds + 6 tens + 7 ones.
Using powers of 10, we can write this more compactly:
4267 = 4 × 103 + 2 × 102 + 6 × 101 + 7 × 100.
The decimal point allows us to adjoin more places (to the right of the decimal point), with place values
less than 1. Thus
23.59 stands for
2 tens + 3 ones + 5 tenths + 9 hundredths.
The ﬁrst place to the right of the decimal point has the place value 1
10, or one tenth; the second place to
the right of the decimal point has the place value
1
100, or one hundredth, and so forth. More generally,
The nth place to the right of the decimal point has the place value
1
10n.
This is a continuation of the pattern we established in Chapter 1: as we move to the right, place values
decrease ten-fold (by a factor of one tenth). If we adopt the convention that
10−n =
1
10n ,
then the sequence of place values, from left to right, is just the sequence of decreasing powers of ten:
... , 103,
102,
101,
100
(decimal point)
10−1,
10−2,
10−3,
...
... , thousands, hundreds, tens, ones
(decimal point)
tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ...
Example 97. Name the digit in tens place, and the digit in the hundredths place, in the decimal
304.671.
Solution. The tens (101) place is the second place to the left of the decimal point. The digit in that
place is 0. The hundredths (10−2) place is the second place to the right of the decimal point. The digit
in that place is 7.
Example 98. What is the digit in the ten-thousandths place of the decimal 0.00286?
Solution. One ten-thousandth is
1
10000 =
1
104 ,
so the ten-thousandths place is the fourth place to the right of the decimal point. The digit in that
place is 8.

Signiﬁcant and Insigniﬁcant 0’s
Decimals are read aloud in the following way:
• read the whole number part;
• read “and” for the decimal point;
• read the digits to the right of the decimal point as if they represented a whole number;
• append the place-name of the last decimal place.
Example 99. (a) 1.13 is read aloud as “one and thirteen hundredths.”
(b) 31.045 is read aloud as “thirty-one and forty-ﬁve thousandths”.
(c) 48.006 is read aloud as “forty-eight and six thousandths.”
In the decimal 48.006, the fractional part .006 stands for 0 tenths + 0 hundredths + 6 thousandths.
Reading aloud, we simply say “six thousandths.” Nonetheless, the two 0’s in .006 are absolutely necessary.
If we had written .6 instead of .006, we would have named a diﬀerent fraction, namely,
6
10, rather than
6
1000. On the other hand, in the decmial 006.23, the ﬁrst two 0’s are unnecessary, since the whole
number 006 is just 6. In one instance the 0’s are crucial, and in the other, they are unnecessary.
How do we know which 0’s are signiﬁcant, and which are insigniﬁcant? We can precede any whole
number or whole number part of a decimal by as many 0’s as we want, because these 0’s do not change
the value of the number (as in 006 = 6). Similarly, we can follow the fractional part of a decimal
with as many 0’s as we want, because these 0’s do not change the value of the number. For example,
.98000 = .98 because .98000 = 9 × 10−1 + 8 × 10−2 + 0 × 10−3 +0 × 10−4 + 0 × 10−5. In these cases,
the 0’s are insigniﬁcant. In contrast, internal 0’s hold a place and cannot be omitted.
Page 93
Example 100. 2.3004 is not equal to 2.304, or to 2.34, because the fractional parts,
3004
10000,
304
1000, and
34
100 are not equal. The 0’s in the hundredths and thousandths places of 42.3004 are signiﬁcant, and
therefore cannot be omitted.
In a decimal, a 0 digit is insigniﬁcant, and may be omitted, if (and only if)
• it precedes the left-most non-zero digit of the whole number part; or
• it follows the right-most non-zero digit of the fractional part.
All other 0’s are signiﬁcant, and cannot be omitted.
Example 101. In the decimal 0304.90800, the 0 between 3 and 4, and the 0 between 9 and 8 are
signiﬁcant; the others are insigniﬁcant. Thus
0304.90800 = 304.908.
Example 102. Does 23400 contain any insigniﬁcant 0’s?
Solution. 23400 is a whole number. The decimal point is not shown, but is “understood” to be at the
rightmost end. It follows that the two 0’s in 23400 are internal, and therefore, signiﬁcant.
It is sometimes convenient to preserve or adjoin non-signiﬁcant 0’s. For example, when a decimal
represents a proper fraction, the whole number part is 0, but that 0, to the left of the decimal point, is
often retained for emphasis or clarity, even though it is insigniﬁcant. Thus the proper fraction
67
100 = .67
is often written as 0.67.
3.3
Comparing Decimals
Insigniﬁcant 0’s are also useful in comparing decimals as to size. Recall that when fractions have the
same (common) denominator, the one with the largest numerator represents the largest number. It is
very easy to ﬁnd a common denominator for two or more decimals, because the number of decimal
places to the right of the decimal point is all that is needed to determine the denominator: if there are
n places to the right of the decimal point, the denominator is 10n. Given a set of decimals, we just
ﬁnd the one with the largest number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point, and use that
number to determine the common denominator. There is no computation involved: we simply “pad
out” the shorter decimals with insigniﬁcant 0’s to the right of the decimal place until all have the same
number of decimal places. Then it is easy to tell which decimal has the largest numerator, and hence,
which is largest.
Example 103. Arrange the decimals in descending order, from largest to smallest: 0.102, 0.09876, 0.2.
Solution. Of the three given decimals, 0.09876 is the longest, with 5 places to the right of the decimal
point. So we pad out all three to 5 places, using insigniﬁcant 0’s: Thus
0.102 = 0.10200
(3.1)
0.09876 = 0.09876
0.2 = 0.20000
Page 94
In this form, the decimals have a common denominator of 105 = 100000:
0.102 = 10200
100000
0.09876 =
9876
100000
0.2 = 20000
100000.
Now, it is easy to see which has the largest numerator, which the second-largest, and which the smallest.
Hence we have
0.2 > 0.102 > 0.09876.

Rounding-oﬀ
The numbers
0.1,
0.11,
0.111,
0.1111,
0.11111
get closer and closer together (on the number line) as we move from left to right. After a few steps,
they are almost too close together to visualize. The second number was obtained from the ﬁrst by
adding
1
100, and the last from the second-to-last by adding just
1
100000, a very small quantity indeed.
Such small quantities can be important in the sciences, but even in circumstances where precision is
important, there is always a limit beyond which small diﬀerences become negligible – not worth worrying
about. (For example, when your bank calculates the interest on your savings account, it calculates, but
then ignores, amounts that are less than one half of one cent.) Being precise, but not overly precise, is
the purpose of rounding-oﬀ numbers.
To round oﬀ a number, we must ﬁrst decide how precise to be. That means choosing the place
whose value we consider the smallest worth worrying about. For example, in negotiating an annual
salary, we would probably not argue about amounts less than $100, but in negotiating an hourly wage,
we would be willing to argue about pennies. In the ﬁrst instance, we would round oﬀ our dollar amounts
to the nearest hundred, and in the second, to the nearest hundredth (cent).
Page 95
Example 104. $175 is closer to $200 than to $100, so, rounding to the nearest hundred, we say that
an annual salary of $36, 175 is approximately $36, 200. We write
36175 ≈ 36200
(to the nearest hundred).
The symbol ≈ means “approximately equal to.”
Example 105. 16.84 is closer to 16.80 than to 16.90, so, to the nearest tenth,
16.84 ≈ 16.8.
Notice that we dropped the insigniﬁcant 0 in 16.80.
Example 106. 0.135 is exactly halfway between 0.130 and 0.140, so, if we want to round to the nearest
hundredth, it is not clear whether we should round “up” to 0.140, or “down” to 0.130. Here, we have
to make up a rule. The convention is that “halfway is almost home,” so we round up.
0.135 ≈ 0.14
(to the nearest hundredth),
where, again, we have dropped the insigniﬁcant 0 in 0.140.
Below is a summary of the procedure for rounding oﬀ a number expressed as a decimal to a given
place, called the round-oﬀ place.
To round oﬀ a decimal to a given place (the round-oﬀ place):
1. Preserve the digit in the round-oﬀ place if the right-neighboring digit is less
than 5; otherwise, increase the digit in the round-oﬀ place by 1;
2. Replace all digits to the right of the round-oﬀ place by 0’s;
3. Eliminate insigniﬁcant 0’s (except a 0 in the round-oﬀ place).
Example 107. Round 26.03 to the nearest tenth.
Solution. The round-oﬀ place is the tenths place, and the right-neighboring digit (3) is less than 5, so
we preserve the digit in the round-oﬀ place (0) and replace all digits to the right (there is only one) with
0. We get 26.00. Here the exception in step 3 of the procedure applies: both the 0’s are insigniﬁcant,
but we keep the 0 in the round-oﬀ place (otherwise it might seem as if we had rounded to the nearest
unit). Thus
26.03 ≈ 26.0
(to the nearest tenth)
Example 108. Round 51 to the nearest hundred.
Solution. The round oﬀ place (hundreds) doesn’t appear, but we can show it by adjoining an insigniﬁcant
0 on the left: 51 = 051. The right neighbor of the round-oﬀ digit is 5, so, by the “halfway” convention,
we round the 0 in the round-oﬀ place up to 1, and replace all digits to the right with 0. We get
51 ≈ 100
(to the nearest hundred).
Notice that the two 0’s in 100 are signiﬁcant, and cannot be eliminated!
Page 96
One ﬁnal remark about step 2 of the procedure. If the digit in the round-oﬀ place is 9, and we need
to round up (to 10), we must carry the 1 to the left-neighboring place.
Example 109. Round 6.597 to the nearest hundredth.
Solution. The 9 in the round-oﬀ place has right-neighbor 7, which is greater than 5. So we increase 9
to 10, and carry the 1 to the (left-neighboring) tenths place:
6.597 ≈ 6.60
(to the nearest hundredth)
Notice we preserved the insigniﬁcant 0, since it is in the round-oﬀ place.

Adding and Subtracting Decimals
One of the advantages of decimals over ordinary fractions is ease of computation. The four operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) are done almost exactly as with whole numbers. The
only question is where to put the decimal point.
Addition and subtraction are the easiest: we line up the numbers vertically, with the ones places
aligned on top of eachother. This puts the decimal points in alignment as well. The decimal point in the
sum is placed directly below the decimal points in the numbers being added. Carrying and borrowing
are done as with whole numbers.
Example 110. Find the sum of 96.8 and 342.03.
Solution. Line up the numbers vertically so that the ones places (and hence the neighboring decimal
points) are directly on top of eachother.

For clarity, you can “pad out” the top number with an insigniﬁcant 0 so that both numbers have the
same number of decimal places. (This is not strictly necessary: just remember that an empty place is
occupied by a 0.) Place a decimal point, vertically aligned with the others, where the sum will go.

whole number 107, the decimal point is understood to be directly to the right of the ones place. Add
the columns from right to left, imagining 0’s in the empty places, and carrying when necessary.

Multiplying and Dividing Decimals by Powers of 10
What happens when we multiply a whole number by 10? Ones become tens, tens become hundreds ,
hundreds become thousands , etc. For example, in the multiplication
234 × 10 = 2340,
the 4 ones in 234 turn into the 4 tens in 2340, the 3 tens turn into 3 hundreds and so forth. (In the
product, there are no longer any ones , and that fact must be recorded with a signiﬁcant 0 in the ones
place.)
Remember that a whole number is a decimal, with the decimal point understood to be immediately
to the right of the ones place. Making the decimal point explicit in our example,
234.0 × 10 = 2340.
We can describe what happens this way: when we multiply by 10, all the digits shift one place to the
left, including the insigniﬁcant 0 which was understood to be in the tenths place of the whole number
234. (In this description, we imagine the decimal point remaining ﬁxed.) Similarly, if we multiply a
whole number by 100, all the digits shift two places to the left, including the two insigniﬁcant 0’s
which are understood to be in the tenths and hundredths places. Thus, 597 × 100 = 59 700, or, more
explicitly,
597.00 × 100 = 59 700.
In general, if we multiply a whole number by any positive power of 10, say, by 10n, all the digits shift n
places to the left, including the n insigniﬁcant 0’s understood to be in the n places to the right of the
decimal point (while the decimal point remains ﬁxed). Thus, for example,
281 × 104 = 2 810 000.
Page 99
If there are non-zero digits to the right of the decimal place, they shift in exactly the same way.
Here are some examples:
38.623 × 100 = 3862.3
0.6 × 10 = 6
0.0031 × 1000 = 3.1
12.09 × 104 = 120 900
100 × 102 = 10000.
Note that insigniﬁcant 0’s have been omitted from the products.
It is often convenient to imagine that, when multiplying by a power of 10, the digits remain ﬁxed
while the decimal point moves (to the right ). (Electronic calculators work this way, using a “ﬂoating”
decimal point.) This description leads to a very easy rule for multiplying a decimal by a positive power
of 10:
To multiply a decimal by 10n, move the decimal point n places to the right.
If we divide a decimal by 10, hundreds becomes tens , tens become ones, ones become tenths ,
tenths become hundredths , etc. The whole discussion above can be repeated, except that, in this case
of division, digits shift to the right , or, equivalently, the decimal point moves to the left . The easy rule
is
To divide a decimal by 10n, move the decimal point n places to the left.
Here are some examples:
623 ÷ 10 = 62.3
0.023 ÷ 100 = 0.00023
480 ÷ 10 = 48
37.5 ÷ 103 = 0.0375
With the convention that
10−n =
1
10n ,
division by 10n can be thought of as multiplication by 10−n. For example,
5 ÷ 100 = 5 × 10−2 = 0.05
6.5 ÷ 10 = 6.5 × 10−1 = 0.65
86.37 ÷ 10000 = 86.37 × 10−4 = 0.008637
8 ÷ 100000 = 8 × 10−5 = 0.00008
Notice that the left movement of the decimal point is indicated by the negative exponent.

Multiplication of general decimals
We already know how to multiply and divide decimals when one of them is a power of 10. If neither
factor is a power of ten, there is more to the process than just moving the decimal point. Consider the
following example.
Example 113. Multiply 0.3 × 0.07.
Solution. Writing this as a product of ordinary fractions, we get
0.3 × 0.07 = 3
10 ×
7
100 =
3 × 7
10 × 100 =
21
1000.
The last fraction can be written 21 ÷ 103, or 21 × 10−3 which, from the results of the last section, is
equal to 0.021. Thus,
0.3 × 0.07 = 0.021.
Multiplication of two decimals always involves a whole number multiplication for the numerator
(3 × 7 = 21 in the example) and a multiplication of powers of 10 for the denominator (10 × 100 =
101 × 102 = 1000 = 103 in the example). By looking back at the previous section, it is easy to see the
product of two powers of 10 is itself a power of 10. Which power of 10? The rule is simple:
10n ×10m = 10(n+m)
Page 101
This implies that the number of decimal places in the product of two (or more) decimals is the sum of
the numbers of decimal places in the factors. Thus any set of decimals can be multiplied by following
a two step procedure:
To multiply two or more decimals:
• Multiply the decimals as if they were whole numbers, ignoring the decimal
points (this gives the numerator of the decimal fraction);
• Add the number of decimal places in each factor (this gives the denominator
of the decimal fraction by specifying the number of decimal places).
Example 114. Find the product 21.02 × 0.004.
Solution. Temporarily ignoring the decimal points, we multiply 2102 × 4 = 8408. Now 21.02 has two
decimal places, and 0.004 has three. So the product will have 2+ 3 = 5 decimal places. In other words,
21.02 × 0.004 = 8408 ÷ 105 = 0.08408.
Example 115. Find the product of 12, 0.3, and 0.004.
Solution. Ignoring the decimal points, the product is 12 × 3 × 4 = 144. The numbers of decimal places
in the three decimals are, left to right, 0, 1 and 3, which add up to 4. Thus,
12 × 0.3 × 0.004 = 144 ÷ 104 = 0.0144.

Division of a decimal by a whole number
If the divisor is a whole number, the division procedure is almost exactly like the long division procedure
for whole numbers. The only diﬀerence is this: a decimal point is placed where the quotient will go,
vertically aligned with the decimal point in the dividend. For example, to set up the division 12.0342÷31,
we write, as before
1 2 . 0 3 4 2
3 1
Then we put a decimal point vertically aligned with the decimal point in the divisor, where the quotient
will go:
1 2 . 0 3 4 2
3 1
.
Now the long division is performed with no further attention paid to the decimal point. In this example,
since 31 is bigger than 12, we put 0 in the units place of the quotient. Continuing, we estimate that 31
goes into 120 3 times, so 3 is placed in the next (tenths) place in the quotient, and 3× 31 is subtracted
from 120 to yield 27. (Note that the decimal point between 2 and 0 is ignored at this point.)
1 2 . 0 3 4 2
3 1
0 . 3
− 9 3
2 7
We bring down the next digit in the dividend, which is 3, and start over with a new dividend of 273.
We estimate that 31 goes into 273 8 times. 8 × 31 = 248, which is subtracted from 273 to yield 25.

Thus, 12.0342 ÷ 31 = 0.3882, with 0 remainder. We can check the result by multiplication, of course:
31 × 0.3882 = 12.0342, as it should.
In this example, the remainder was 0. In fact, because of the decimal point, we never need to write
remainders again. The reason is that we can always adjoin insigniﬁcant 0’s to to the end of the dividend,
bring them down, and so continue the division process.
Example 116. Perform the division 12.4 ÷ 5.
Solution. We set up the long division process as before, with a decimal point where the quotient will
go, directly above the decimal point in the dividend.

0
The 0 remainder signals the end of the process. Thus 13.4 ÷ 5 = 2.68.
Since we can adjoin as many insigniﬁcant 0’s as we need, it might seem that we can always continue
until we get a 0 remainder. But this doesn’t always happen. Sometimes, we never get a 0 remainder,
but instead, we get a sequence of non-zero remainders that repeats, forever. In this case, we get what
is know as a repeating decimal.
Example 117. Perform the division 3.2 ÷ 11.
Solution. We set up the long division process as usual.

11 goes into 32 twice with a remainder of 10:

Adjoin an insigniﬁcant 0 to the dividend, bring it down, and perform another step: 11 goes into 100 9
times with a remainder of 1.

Now if we adjoin another insigniﬁcant 0 to the dividend, and bring it down, we see that 11 goes into 10
0 times. We record that with a 0 digit in the quotient, adjoin another insigniﬁcant 0 to the dividend,
and bring it down. Now we see that (as above) 11 goes into 100 9 times with a remainder of 1.

It is evident that these last two steps will now repeat again and again, forever. The decimal will never
terminate, since a 0 remainder will never occur. Still, it is easy to describe the quotient: it will consist
of 29 after the decimal point, followed by an endless string of 09’s. To indicate this, we put a bar over
the repeated string:
0.2909090909090909 · · · = 0.2909.
Thus, 3.2 ÷ 11 = 0.2909.
We emphasize that it may take a while for the digits to start repeating, and the bar is only placed
over the repeating part. For example, the repeating decimal
0.796812341234123412341234 ...
is written, using the bar notation, as
0.79681234.
The repeated string can be quite long, or just a single digit. Here are some examples, which you
should verify by carrying out the division process:
3 ÷ 7 = 0.428571
2 ÷ 11 = 0.09
5 ÷ 3 = 1.6
Sometimes, we don’t care whether a decimal terminates or repeats. For example, if we know in
advance that we can round oﬀ our answer to a given decimal place, we carry out the division only as
far as the right neighboring place and stop (this gives us all we need to know to round oﬀ).
Example 118. Suppose you bought 900 buttons for $421. To the nearest cent, how much did you
spend for each button?
Solution. We need to perform the division 421 ÷ 900. Since we are rounding to the nearest hundredth
(cent), we need only carry out the division as far as the thousandths place. Since the thousandths
place is the the third place to the right of the decimal point, we adjoin three insigniﬁcant 0’s to the
dividend, setting up the division as 421.000 ÷ 900. We omit the details, but you can verify that the
quotient, carried out to three decimal places, is 0.467, which, rounded to the nearest hundredth, is 0.47.
Therefore, the buttons cost approximately 47 cents each.
If you carried out the division process a little further, you noticed that the quotient is actually a
repeating decimal:
421 ÷ 900 = 0.46777777 · · · = 0.467.

Division of a decimal by a decimal
What do we do when the divisor is a decimal? For example, how do we perform the division 8.61÷ 2.5?
The answer is simple. Just multiply both the dividend and divisor by a power of 10 suﬃciently large
to make the divisor into a whole number, and then proceed as before. In this example, if we multiply
both numbers by 101, the divisor 2.5 turns into the whole number 25 and the dividend turns into 86.1.
Recall that two fractions are equivalent, that is, represent the same number, if one is obtained from the
other by multiplying both numerator and denominator by the same nonzero number. In this case, the
convenient choice of nonzero multiplier is 101 = 10, because it turns the denominator (divisor) into a
whole number. Thus,
8.61
2.5 = 8.61 × 10
2.5 × 10 = 86.1
25 .
In other words, the division problem 8.61÷2.5 has the same quotient as the division problem 86.1÷25.
We do the latter problem exactly as in the previous section.
8 6 . 1 0 0

1 1 1
− 1 0 0
1 1 0
− 1 0 0
1 0 0
− 1 0 0

Page 108
Since the remainder is 0, the quotient is a terminating decimal. 8.61 ÷ 2.5 = 3.444. (Question: why
didn’t we write 3.4?)
Example 119. Perform the division 32.067÷6.41 and round oﬀ the quotient to the nearest hundredth.
Solution. There are two decimal places in the divisor, 6.41, so multiplying it by 102 = 100 will give
us a whole number: 6.41 × 102 = 641. Doing the same to the dividend yields the equivalent division
problem,
3206.7 ÷ 641.
Since we are rounding oﬀ to the nearest hundredth, we will need to carry out the division to the
thousandths place. We therefore add two insigniﬁcant 0’s to the dividend, and perform the division as
follows:
3 2 0 6 . 7 0 0
6 4 1
5 . 0 0 2
−
3 2 0 5
1 7 0 0
−
1 2 8 2
4 1 8
Since the digit in the thousandths place of the quotient is less than 5, we preserve the digit in the
hundredths place. The quotient is ≈ 5.00 (to the nearest hundredth).

Percents, Conversions
A percent is a fraction in which the denominator is 100. The word “percent” comes from the Latin
phrase per centum meaning “out of 100,” and is symbolized by %. For example,
97%
means
97
100
or
0.97.
Percents need not be whole numbers, and they need not represent proper fractions. For example,
150% = 150
100 = 1.5
0.5% = 0.5
100 = 0.005
Fractions, decimals, and percents represent the same quantities in diﬀerent ways, and we need to
know how to convert one to another.
A decimal can be converted to a percent by moving the decimal point two places to the right and
adjoining the % symbol. This is the same as multiplying the decimal fraction by 100, which exactly
cancels the denominator, leaving just the numerator (the percent). Thus
0.68 = 68%
2.05 = 205%
0.708 = 70.8%
1.4 = 140%
0.0067 = 0.67%
To convert a percent back into a decimal, we simply divide by 100, which, as we know, is equivalent
to moving the decimal point two places to the left. Thus
92% = 0.92
0.2% = 0.002
138% = 1.38
71.02% = 0.7102
To convert a percent to a fraction (or mixed number), ﬁrst convert the percent to a decimal, as
above, then express the decimal as a fraction (with a visible denominator), and ﬁnally, reduce the fraction
to lowest terms, if needed.
Example 120. Convert 10.8% into a fraction in lowest terms.
Solution. We ﬁrst write 10.8% as a decimal.
10.8% = 0.108.
Then, we write the decimal as a fraction with a visible denominator. In this case, because there are 3
decimal places, the denominator is 1000.
0.108 = 108
1000.
Page 110
Finally, the GCF of the numerator and denominator is 4, so we cancel 4 from both of these numbers,
obtaining a fraction in lowest terms:
108
1000 =

: 27
108

: 250
1000
= 27
250.
Here are some common percents with their decimal and fractional equivalents (in lowest terms):
10% = 0.1 = 1
10,
20% = 0.2 = 1
5,
25% = 0.25 = 1
4,
50% = 0.5 = 1
2.
To convert a fraction to a decimal, we just perform long division.
Example 121. Convert 1
4 to a decimal.
Solution. Performing the division 1 ÷ 4, we obtain
1 . 0 0
4
0 . 2 5
−
8
2 0
− 2 0

Thus 1
4 = 0.25.
To convert a fraction to a percent, ﬁrst convert it to a decimal, and then convert the decimal to a
percent.
Example 122. Convert
1
40 to a percent.
Solution. Performing the division 1 ÷ 40, we obtain 0.025 (verify this – it is quite similar to the last
example). Then, we convert 0.025 to a percent by multiplying by 100 (equivalently, by moving the
decimal point two places to the right). We obtain
1
40 = 2.5%.

Fractional parts of numbers
We now have several ways of indicating a fractional part of a number. For example, the phrases
1
4
of
90
0.25
of
90
25%
of
90
are all diﬀerent ways of describing the number 1
4 × 90 = 22.5. The word “of” indicates multiplication.
In the case of percent, the multiplication is done after ﬁrst converting the percent to a fraction or a
decimal.
The fractional part taken need not be a proper fractional part. That is, we could end up with more
than we started with.
Example 123. Find 125% of 500.
Solution. Converting the percent to the decimal 1.25, and then multiplying by 500, we get
1.25 × 500 = 625.
Example 124. Sales tax in New York State is 81
4%. What is the sales tax on a shirt priced at $25?
Solution. 81
4 = 8.25, and 8.25%, as a decimal, is .0825. So the sales tax on a $25 shirt is
.0825 × 25 = 2.0625 ≈ $2.06.
Note that we rounded oﬀ to the nearest cent.
Example 125. Josh spends 2
5 of his income on rent. If he earns $1250 per month, how much does he

Chapter 4
Ratio and Proportion
In this chapter we develop another interpretation of fractions, as comparisons between two quantities.
4.1
Ratio
If a team wins ten games and loses ﬁve, we say that the ratio of wins to losses is 2 : 1, or “2 to 1.”
Where did the numbers 2 : 1 come from? We simply made a fraction whose numerator is the number
of games the team won, and whose denominator is the number of games they lost, and reduced it to
lowest terms:
wins
losses = 10
5 = 2
1.
We can do the same for any two quantities, a and b, as long as b ̸= 0.
The ratio of a to b (b ̸= 0) is the fraction a
b, reduced
to lowest terms.
Example 126. Find (a) the ratio of 9 to 18, (b) the ratio of 21 to 12, (c) the ratio of 64 to 4.
Solution. (a) The ratio of 9 to 18 is
9
18 = 1
2
or
1 : 2.
(b) The ratio of 21 to 12 is
21
12 = 7
4
or
7 : 4.
(c) The ratio of 64 to 4 is
64
4 = 16
1
or
16 : 1.
Notice that in (c) we left the denominator 1 (rather than just writing 16) to maintain the idea of a
comparison between two numbers.
We can form ratios of non-whole numbers. When the ratio is expressed in lowest terms, however,
it is always the ratio of two whole numbers, as small as possible. This is the main point of a ratio
comparison: if the given two numbers were small whole numbers, how would they compare?
Example 127. What is the ratio of 33
4 to 11
2?
115
Solution. Converting the mixed numbers to improper fractions, and rewriting the division as multipli-
cation by the reciprocal, we obtain

The ratio is 5 : 2.
Example 128. What is the ratio of 22.5 to 15?
Solution. We could perform the decimal division 22.5 ÷ 15, but it is easier to simplify the equivalent
fraction
225
150 = 3
2.
The ratio is 3 : 2.
When ﬁnding the ratio of two measurable quantities, we must be sure the quantities are expressed
in the same units. Otherwise the ratio will be a skewed or false comparison.
Example 129. Find the ratio of 15 dollars to 30 cents.
Solution. If we form the ratio 15
30 = 1
2, we imply that a person walking around with $15 in his pocket
has half as much money as a person walking around with only 30 cents! The proper comparison is
obtained by converting both numbers to the same units. In this case, we convert dollars to cents. The
correct ratio is
1500 cents
30 cents
= 50
1 .
Example 130. Manuel gets a ﬁve minute break for every hour he works. What is the ratio of work time
to break time?
Solution. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the ratio of work time to break time is
55 minutes
5 minutes = 11
1 .
Recall that percent (%) means “per hundred.” So a percent can be viewed as a ratio whose second
term (denominator) is 100.
Example 131. At a certain community college, 55% of the students are female. Find (a) the ratio of
female students to the total number of students, and (b) the ratio of female students to male students.
Solution. 55% indicates the fraction
55
100 = 11
20,
so the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 11 : 20. For (b), we ﬁrst deduce that
45% of the students are male (since 45% = 100% − 55% ). So the ratio of female students to male
students is
55
45 = 11

or
11 : 9.

margins.) The width of the printed text is the diﬀerence

Proportions
A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. Thus
40
20 = 10
5
is a proportion, because both ratios are equivalent to the ratio 2 : 1 (= the fraction 2
1).
Page 117
A proportion is a statement of the form
a
b = c
d
where b, d ̸= 0.
4.2.1
The cross-product property
There is a very useful fact about proportions: If the proportion a
b = c
d is true, then the “cross-products,”
ad and bc, are equal, and, conversely, if the cross-products are equal, then the proportion must be true.
Example 133. Verify that the cross-products are equal in the (true) proportion
40
20 = 10
5 .
Solution. 40 × 5 = 10 × 20 = 200.
The general cross-product property is stated below for reference:
a
b = c
d
if and only if
ad = bc.
To prove the cross-product property, we need to say a little bit about equations. An equation is a
mathematical statement of the form X = Y . If the equation X = Y is true, and N is any nonzero
number, then the following equations are also true, and have exactly the same solution(s):
N × X = N × Y
and
X
N = Y
N .
Now go back to the proportion a
b = c
d , and multiply both sides by the nonzero number bd. We get
bd a
b = bd c
d .
Cancelling b on the left and d on the right yields the cross-product property, ad = bc. Conversely, if
we have four numbers a, b, c, d, (b, d ̸= 0), and we know that ad = bc, then, dividing both sides by
the nonzero number bd gives us the proportion a
b = c
d .
Example 134. Decide if the given proportions are true or false, using the cross-product property. (a)
3
11 = 2
7;
(b) 4
10 = 6
15.
Solution. (a) The cross-products are 3 · 7 = 21 and 2 · 11 = 22. They are not equal, so the proportion
is false. (b) The cross-products are 4 · 15 and 10 · 6, both equal to 60. So the proportion is true.
Page 118
4.2.2
Solving a proportion
If one of the four terms of a proportion is missing or unknown, it can be found using the cross-product
property. This procedure is called solving the proportion. In the proportion below, x represents an
unknown term (any other letter would do).
x
3 = 34
51.
There is a unique x which makes the proportion true, namely, the one which makes the cross-products,
51x and 34(3), equal. The equation
51x = 34(3) = 102
can be divided by 51 (the number which multiplies x) on both sides, giving
51x
51 = 102
51 .
Cancellation yields

51x

51
= 2.
It follows that
x = 2
which is the solution of the proportion.
It doesn’t matter which of the four terms is missing; the proportion can always be solved by a similar
procedure.
Example 135. Solve the proportion
9
100 = 36
y
for the unknown term y.
Solution. The cross-products must be equal, so
9y = 3600.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 (the number which multiplies y), and cancelling, yields

y = 400.
The unknown term is 400. We check our solution by verifying that the cross-products
9(400) = 36(100) = 3600
are equal.
Neither the terms nor the solution of a proportion are necessarily whole numbers.

Example 136. Solve the proportion
10
B = 15

Solution. Setting the cross products equal,

Example 138. Solve the proportion

Page 120
Solution. We could immediately set the cross-products equal, but it is simpler to ﬁrst reduce the fraction
42
70 to its lowest terms, using – by the way– a proportion: 42
70 = 3
5. Stringing two proportions together
3
5 = 42
70 = x

lets us skip over the middle fraction. It is evident that the solution to our original proportion is the
solution to the simpler proportion
3
5 = x
1.5.
Setting the cross-products equal
4.5 = 5x,
we obtain the solution x = 4.5
5 = 0.9.
We summarize the procedure for solving a proportion.
To solve a proportion,
1. Reduce the numerical ratio (not containing the
unknown) to lowest terms, if necessary;
2. Set the cross-products equal;
3. Divide both sides of the resulting equation by
the number multiplying the unknown term.
To check the solution,
1. In the original proportion, replace the unknown
term with the solution you obtained;
2. Verify that the cross-products are equal.
Equivalence of fractions, and hence, most of fraction arithmetic, is based on proportion. To add

for example, we ﬁrst solve the two proportions
1
2 = x
6
and

3 = y

(a task we have performed up to now without much comment) so that the fractions can be written with
the LCD (6). Then
1

Practice: solve the two proportions for x and y.

Percent problems
Any problem involving percent can be stated (or restated) in the form
“A is P percent of B”
where one of the numbers A, B or P is unknown. We can make this into a mathematical equation by
making the following “translations:”
“is”
←→
=
“P percent”
←→
P
100
“of”
←→
×
This gives us the equation
A = P
100 × B.
If we divide both sides of the equation by B, we obtain the proportion in the box below.
Page 122
The statement “A is P percent of B” is equivalent to the proportion
A
B = P
100.
The letter B is used to suggest “base amount” – that is, B is the amount from which (or of which)
a percentage is taken. Notice that B follows “of” in the verbal statement. It could be that A (the
percentage taken) is greater than B, but only if the percentage P is greater than 100.
In the following examples, the phrase involving “what,” as in “what number?” or “what percent?”
helps determine which of A, B of P is the unknown.
Example 139. 6 is what percent of 300?
Solution. The percent is unknown, and the base amount B is 300 (since it follows the word “of”). We
can restate the question as: “6 is P percent of 300.” The corresponding proportion is
6
300 = P
100
and the solution (verify it!) is P = 2. Therefore, 6 is 2% of 300.
Example 140. What number is 8% of 150?
Solution. The base amount B is 150, since it follows the word “of,” the percentage is P = 8, and there-
fore A is the unknown amount. The question can be restated as: “A is 8% of 150.” The corresponding
proportion is
A
150 =
8
100
and the solution is A = 12 (verify!). It follows that 12 is 8% of 150.
(Note that this result could have been obtained without using a proportion, since 8% of 150 simply
means .08 × 150 = 12.)
Example 141. 58% of what number is 290?
Solution. The base amount B is unknown, and A is 290. The question can be restated as “58% of B
is 290.” The corresponding proportion is
290
B
= 58
100
and the solution is 29000
58
= 500. So 58% of 500 is 290.
Everyday questions involving percent are not always as straightforward as in the previous examples.
But with a little thought, they can be converted into such statements.
Example 142. Approximately 55% of the students enrolled at BCC are female. If there are 2970 female
students, what is the total enrollment at BCC?
Page 123
Solution. According to the given information, 2970 is 55% of the total enrollment, which is the base
amount, B. The question can be restated as “2970 is 55% of B” and the corresponding proportion is
therefore
2970
B
= 55
100.
Using lowest terms of the fraction
55
100 = 11
20, we solve
2970
B
= 11
20
59400 = 11B
B = 59400
11
= 5400.
The total enrollment is 5400 students. To check, verify that 55% of 5400 is 2970.
Example 143. Full-time tuition at a university increased from $2, 850 to $3, 000. What was the percent
increase in the tuition? (Round to the nearest tenth of a percent.)
Solution. The tuition increased by $3000 − 2850 = $150. The percent increase is the ratio
amount of increase
original tuition
= 150
2850,
expressed as a percent. Equivalently, we want to answer the question “$150 is what percent of $2850?”
We solve the proportion
150
2850 = P
100
(4.1)
3
57 = P
100
57P = 300
P ≈ 5.26
Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, the tuition increase was approximately 5.3%.

Rates
There are lots of real-world quantities which compare in a ﬁxed ratio. For example, for any given car,
the ratio of miles driven to gallons of gas used,
miles
gallon
or
“miles per gallon”
is essentially unchanging, or ﬁxed. If we know, say, that 5 gallons of gas was needed to drive 150
miles, we can predict the amount that will be needed to drive any other distance, by solving a simple
proportion.
Example 144. Maya used 5 gallons of gas to drive 150 miles. How many gallons will she need to drive
225 miles?
Solution. We solve the proportion
150 miles
5 gallon = 225 miles
x gallons ,
where x represents the number of gallons she will need. Before setting the cross-products equal, reduce
the fraction on the left side to 30
1 . Then
30x = 225
(4.2)
x = 225
30 = 71
2.
She will need 71
2 gallons of gas to drive 225 miles.
Miles per gallon is an example of a rate, or comparison of unlike quantities by means of a ratio. In
the example above, the miles per gallon rate for Maya’s car was
150 miles
5 gallons = 150
5
= 30
1
or 30 miles per gallon.
Other examples of rates are: dollars per hour (pay rate for an hourly worker), dollars per item (price of
an item for sale), calories per minute (energy use by an athlete). You can undoubtedly think of many
others.
Page 125
Example 145. A runner burns 375 calories running 3.5 miles. (a) How many calories will she burn in
running a marathon (approximately 26 miles)? (b) What is her rate of energy use (calories per mile)?
Round oﬀ to the nearest whole unit.
Solution. (a) The ratio
calories
miles
is assumed ﬁxed and, from the given information, is equal to
375
3.5 .
Let x denote the number of calories the runner burns in running a marathon. Then
375
3.5 = x calories
26 miles
(setting cross-products equal)
(375)(26) = 3.5x
x = (375)(26)
3.5
≈ 2786.
She will burn approximately 2786 calories running the marathon. (b) Her rate of energy use is
375 calories
3.5 miles
≈ 107
calories per mile.
Example 146. A painting crew can paint three apartments in a week. If a building contains 40 equal

1. If y is the number of weeks needed to paint 40 apartments, then

Similar triangles
Two triangles which have the same shape but possibly diﬀerent sizes are called similar. Having the
same shape means that the three angles of one triangle are equal to the three corresponding angles in
the other.
The triangles below are similar, because the angle at A in the small triangle is equal to the angle at
D in the big triangle (50◦); the angle at B in the small triangle is equal to the angle at E in the big
triangle (95◦); and similarly the angle at C in the small triangle is equal to the angle at F in the large
triangle (35◦).
A
B
C
50◦
95◦
35◦
D

Given any triangle, we can obtain a similar one by enlarging (or reducing) all the side lengths in a ﬁxed
ratio. In the example above, the bigger triangle was obtained from the smaller using the enlargement
ratio 2 : 1. If AB stands for the length of the side AB, etc., then
DE = 2 × AB,
EF = 2 × BC,
and
DF = 2 × AC.
Equivalently,
DE
AB
= EF
BC
= DF
AC
= 2
1.
In words: sides which are opposite equal angles (called corresponding sides) have length ratio equal
to the ratio 2 : 1. We must be careful to compare side lengths in the proper order. In this case, we
used the order larger : smaller, since that is the order in the ratio 2 : 1. We could have used the reverse
order, smaller : larger, but only if we also used the reversed ratio 1 : 2.
If we know, say, that BC is 12 feet, we can solve the proportion
2
1 = EF
12
and determine that EF is 24 feet.
This is the key fact about similar triangles.
Page 127
Corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional:
If: ∠A = ∠D,
∠B = ∠E,
and
∠C = ∠F,
A
B
C
D
E
F
Then:
BC
EF
= AC
DF
= AB
DE .
Example 147. The triangles below are similar, with ∠D = ∠A, ∠E = ∠B and ∠F = ∠C. AB =
15 feet, BC = 12 feet, and DE = 22.5 feet. Find EF.
A
B
C
D
E
F
15 ft.
12 ft.
22.5 ft.
x ft.
Solution. The ratios of the corresponding sides opposite ∠F = ∠C ( DE
AB ) and the corresponding sides
opposite ∠D = ∠A ( EF
BC ) are equal:
DE
AB
= EF
BC .
Filling in the given information, and using x to represent the unknown side length EF, we have
22.5
15 = x
12
(22.5)(12) = 15x
270 = 15x
x = 270
15 = 18.
EF = 18 feet.
We now describe two ways of obtaining a pair of similar triangles. Both involve the notion of parallel
line segments. Two line segments are parallel if they do not cross, even if extended inﬁnitely in either
direction (think of straight train tracks).
Page 128
1. If two sides of a triangle are joined by a line segment parallel to the third side, the resulting
(smaller) triangle is similar to the original triangle.
A

C
A

Starting with triangle ABC on the left, we drew the segment DE, parallel to AB, creating (smaller)
triangle DEC, similar to ABC. Both triangles are visible on the right (the smaller overlapping
the larger), so there was really no need to draw the ﬁrst picture. By similarity, the corresponding
sides are proportional:
smaller triangle
larger triangle
DE
AB
= CD
CA = CE
CB .
2. If a pair of parallel line segments is “cross-connected” as shown, the two triangles formed are
similar.
A
B
C
D
A
B
C
D
E
Starting with the parallel segments AB and CD, we connected D to A and C to B by means of
straight lines (called transversals) which cross at point E. The upper and lower angles at E are
equal. In addition, ∠D = ∠A and ∠C = ∠B. (These facts are visually plausible; they would be
proved in a geometry class.) It follows that triangles ABE and CDE are similar and hence
upper triangle

In the examples and exercises, it will be convenient to use the following symbolism:
∥

“is parallel to”
∼

“is similar to”
△

Solution. Because AB ∥ CD, △ABE ∼ △CDE. Corresponding sides are proportional, hence

EB

EA .
In particular, using EC = 1, EB = 1.5, and ED = .75, and x for the length of AE,
1
1.5 = .75
x
or x = (1.5)(.75) = 1.125. The length of AE is 1.125 inches.
Example 149. In the following ﬁgure, DE ∥ BC. Find the length of BC.
A

AC
AE
= 2 ft. + 2 ft. 4 in.
2 ft.
= BC
DE
=
BC
2 ft. 6 in..
Converting all measurements to inches, and letting x represent the length of BC in inches,
52
24 = x
30
which gives x = 65 inches, or 5 ft. 5 in.

Chapter 5
Signed Numbers
In this chapter we expand the set of numbers available for doing arithmetic. We now include negative
numbers, which lie to the left of 0 on the number line, forming a kind of “mirror image” of the positive
numbers. On the expanded number line, each number (except 0) has a sign. The negative numbers
have sign −, and the positive numbers have sign +. The + sign for positive numbers is understood and
usually omitted. 0 has no sign.

The rule of thumb “left is less” continues to hold on the expanded number line. Thus, for example,
−3 < −1, since −3 lies to the left of −1 on the number line.
The set of negative numbers (like the set of positive numbers), includes not just negative integers,
but also negative fractions such as − 13
3 = −41
3, and negative irrational numbers, such as −
√
2 ≈ −1.41
and −π ≈ −3.14.

The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line. The symbol for absolute
value is a pair of vertical lines, | |. Thus | 0 |= 0 and
| −1 |=| 1 |= 1,
| −
√
2 |=|
√
2 |=
√
2,
| −π |=| π |= π,
etc.
The absolute value of a number cannot be negative, even if the number itself is negative.
This is
because, intuitively, distance is a nonnegative quantity.
5.1
Adding signed numbers
To do arithmetic with signed numbers, we extend the ordinary operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division so that they remain consistent with the familiar operations with nonnegative
numbers. We deﬁne the extended addition operation in terms of motion along the number line, as
follows:
To add a positive number,
move to the right;
To add a negative number,
move to the left.
135
Thus, to add 3 to 2, we imagine starting at 2 on the number line and moving 3 “steps” to the right,
arriving at 5.

2 + (−3) = −1
As the picture shows, we end up at −1. We conclude that 2 + (−3) = −1.
When two signed numbers are added, the order of addition does not aﬀect the sum.
Example 151. Perform the signed number addition (−3) + 2.
Solution. This is just the previous example, with the addition in the reverse order. Now we start at −3,
and move 2 steps right, taking into account the (positive) sign of 2. We arrive at the same result, −1:

More generally, for any two signed numbers,

Addition, extended to signed numbers, remains commutative.
Example 152. Perform the signed number addition −11
2 + (−3) in both possible orders.

In the last example, the absolute value of the sum was the diﬀerence obtained by subtracting the
smaller absolute value from the larger (3.75−2.50 = 1.25), while the sign of the sum (+) was the same
as the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. This is no accident, but illustrates a general
rule about adding numbers with opposite signs.
Page 137
When two signed numbers are added
• if the numbers have opposite signs,
1. the sign of the sum is the sign of the num-
ber with the larger absolute value;
2. the absolute value of the sum is the diﬀer-
ence bewteen the two individual absolute
values (larger − smaller).
• if the two numbers have the same sign,
1. the sign of the sum is the common sign
of the summands;
2. the absolute value of the sum is the sum
of the individual absolute values.
Example 154. Add 15 + (−18).
Solution. The numbers have opposite signs, so the sign of the sum is the same as the sign of the
number with the larger absolute value (−18), i.e., −. The absolute value of the sum is the diﬀerence
| −18 | − | 15 |= 18 − 15 = 3. Thus the sum is −3. This reasoning is summarized as
15 + (−18) = −(18 − 15) = −3.
Example 155. Add −7 + (−9).
Solution. The numbers have the same sign, −, so that is also the sign of the sum. The absolute value
of the sum is the sum of the individual absolute values, | −7 | + | −9 |= 7 + 9 = 16. Thus the sum is
−16. The reasoning is summarized as
−7 + (−9) = −(7 + 9) = −16.
Example 156. Add −3.6 + 4.9.
Solution. The numbers have opposite signs, and the number with the larger absolute value (4.9) de-
termines the sign of the sum (+). The absolute value of the sum is the diﬀerence | 4.9 | − | −3.6 |=
4.9 − 3.6. Thus
−3.6 + 4.9 = +(4.9 − 3.6) = +1.3 = 1.3.
Example 157. Add 43

Solution. The numbers have opposite signs, and the number with the larger absolute value is negative,

values,

Opposites, Identity
There are exactly two numbers at any given non-zero distance from 0, one negative and the other
positive. Pairs of numbers such as {−13
3 , 13
3 }, {−
√
2,
√
2}, {−π, π}, which are unequal but equidistant
from 0, and hence have the same absolute value, are called opposites. (0 is the only number which
is its own opposite, having absolute value 0.) To ﬁnd the opposite of a nonzero number, we simply
change its sign.
Example 158. (a) The opposite of 11 is −11. (b) The opposite of −1.7 is 1.7.
Since there are only two possible signs, the opposite of the opposite of a number is the number we
started with.
The opposite of the opposite of N is N:
−(−N) = N.
Example 159. (a) The opposite of the opposite of 5
8 is −
�
−5
8
�
= 5
8. (b) the opposite of the opposite
of −5 is −(−(−5)) = −5.
Suppose a nonzero number is added to its opposite, for example, 3 + (−3). The rule for adding
signed numbers with opposite signs doesn’t seem to work here: it is not clear what the sign of the sum
should be. But in fact it doesn’t matter since the absolute value of the sum is 0, which has no sign.
Accordingly, −3 + 3 = 0. (Intuitively: if we start at 3 and move 3 steps left, we arrive at 0.) In general,
The sum of a number and its opposite is 0:
N + (−N) = 0.
Example 160. (a) 1
7 +
�
−1
7
�
= 0. (b) −23.04 + 23.04 = 0.
Recall that 0 is the additive identity for ordinary addition because, when 0 is added to a number,
the result is the identical number, i.e, the number does not change.
This remains true for signed
numbers.
Example 161. −4 + 0 = −4.

Associativity
Another important property of addition, associativity, extends to signed number addition. Associativity
of addition means that when three or more numbers are added, it doesn’t matter how you associate
them into groups for addition: x + y + z = (x + y) + z = x + (y + z). Recall that this property allowed
us to add long columns of nonnegative numbers.
We can make use of column addition with signed numbers, too, by associating and adding all
the positive numbers, and, separately, associating and adding the absolute values of all the negative
numbers. Then we add the two subtotals, treating the subtotal associated with the negative numbers
as negative. This way, we apply the signed number rule just once, at the end.
Example 162. Add: 43.6 + (−5.8) + (−135) + 69.5 + (−134) + 158.7 + (−162.3)

Treating the subtotal associated with the negative numbers as negative, we add 271.8 + (−437.1). By
the rule for adding signed numbers with opposite signs,
271.8 + (−437.1) = −(437.1 − 271.8) = −165.3.
If we think of positive numbers as “proﬁts,” and negative numbers as “losses,” then signed number
addition is like “balancing the books.” There is a net gain if the total proﬁts are larger than the total
losses (in absolute value); otherwise there is a net loss.
Example 163. Last week, a business received checks from clients in the amounts of $350.65, $461.00
and $900.78, and paid bills in the amounts of $261.50, $551.00 and $78.70. What was the net proﬁt
or loss for the week?
Solution. Bills paid are losses, so we treat them as negative numbers; checks received are proﬁts, counted
as positive numbers. The total proﬁts are

1712.43 + (−891.20) = +(1712.43 − 891.20) = 821.23.
There was a net proﬁt of $821.23 for the week.

Subtracting signed numbers
The phrase “subtract A from B” indicates the operation B − A. We extend subtraction to signed
numbers by deﬁning it in terms of addition.
To subtract a signed number A from a signed number B,
add B to the opposite of A:
B − A = B + (−A).
With this deﬁnition, there is no longer any real need for a separate operation called subtraction. For
example, instead of subtracting 17 − 9, we could simply add 17 + (−9) (verify that the results are the
same). Despite this, it is convenient to retain the operation of subtraction.
Example 164. (a) Subtract 15 from 9. (b) Subtract 8 from −2.
Solution. (a) 9 − 15 = 9 + (−15). Applying the rule for adding signed numbers with opposite signs,
9 + (−15) = −(15 − 9) = −6.
(b) −2 − 8 = −2 + (−8). Applying the rule for adding signed numbers with the same sign,
−2 + (−8) = −(2 + 8) = −10.
Example 165. Subtract −17 from 12.
Solution. 12 − (−17) = 12 + (−(−17)). Remembering that −(−17) = 17 (opposite of the opposite),
we have
12 − (−17) = 12 + 17 = 29.
Example 166. Subtract (−15) from −32.
Page 143
Solution. −32 − (−15) = −32 + (−(−15)) = −32 + 15. Applying the rule for adding signed numbers
with opposite signs,
−32 − (−15) = −32 + 15 = −(32 − 15) = −17.

values vertically.

Formerly “impossible” subtractions, such as
7 − 12
can now be easily performed.
7 − 12 = 7 + (−12) = −(12 − 7) = −5.
Examples like this show that subtraction is not commutative: changing the order of subtraction changes
the result to its opposite. In general, for any two signed numbers,
B − A = −(A − B).
Example 169. 22 − 100 = −78 = −(100 − 22).
We often need to ﬁnd the diﬀerence of two unequal quantities. By convention, diﬀerence is given
as a positive quantity. If the two quantities are A and B, their diﬀerence is either A − B or B − A
(whichever is positive). Intuitively,
diﬀerence = larger − smaller.
Formally, the diﬀerence of A and B is deﬁned to be the absolute value of A − B.
Page 144
Example 170. Find the diﬀerence in temperature between −2◦ F and 50◦F.
Solution. Intuitively,
higher temperature − lower temperature = 50 − (−2) = 52,
so the temperature diﬀerence is 52◦ F. Formally,
| −2 − 50 |=| −52 |= 52.
Example 171. The summit of Mount Whitney in California is 14505 feet above sea level. Not far away,
in Death Valley, the lowest point is 282 feet below sea level. What is the altitude diﬀerence between
Mount Whitney’s summit and the lowest point in Death Valley?
Solution. Assigning a negative altitude to a point below sea level, the diﬀerence is
14505 − (−282) = 14505 + 282 = 14787 feet.

Multiplying Signed Numbers
Multiplication of positive numbers was deﬁned in terms of repeated addition. For example,
3 × 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.
There is no problem extending this deﬁnition to the product of a negative number by a positive number.
3 × (−4) = (−4) + (−4) + (−4) = −12.
Products such as
(−2) × 5
pose no problem if, for consistency, we deﬁne signed number multiplication to be commutative (we do):
(−2) × 5 = 5 × (−2) = (−2) + (−2) + (−2) + (−2) + (−2) = −10.
The general rule is:
The product of two numbers with opposite signs is the negative of the product of their
absolute values.
Example 172. Find the products (a) 7 × (−11) and (b) (−12) × 5.
Solution. We take the negative of the product of the absolute values in each case. (a) 7 × (−11) =
−(7 × 11) = −77. (b) (−12) × 5 = −(12 × 5) = −60.
When it comes to the product of two negative numbers, our intuition fails. It makes no sense to
“repeatedly” add a number to itself when the number of repeats is negative! How should we deﬁne
(−2) × (−3)?
It is best to give up on intuition and let consistency rule. Look at the pattern below:
4 × (−3) = −12
= the opposite of 4 × 3
3 × (−3) = −9
= the opposite of 3 × 3
2 × (−3) = −6
= the opposite of 2 × 3
1 × (−3) = −3
= the opposite of 1 × 3
0 × (−3) = 0
= the opposite of 0 × 3
(−1) × (−3) =
= ?
(−2) × (−3) =
= ??
Page 146
It looks like the pattern “ought” to continue as follows:
(−1) × (−3) = 3
the opposite of (−1) × 3
(−2) × (−3) = 6
the opposite of (−2) × 3
We make the following general deﬁnition:
The product of two negative numbers is the (positive!) product of their absolute values.
Example 173. Find the product (−8) × (−12).
Solution. (−8) × (−12) = 8 × 12 = 96.
Note that the product of two positive numbers could also be deﬁned as the (positive) product of their
absolute values. So our deﬁnition is consistent with what we already know about positive numbers, and
applies whenever numbers with the same sign are multiplied.
[OPTIONAL: If you ﬁnd it hard to accept that the product of two negative numbers is positive,
the following discussion might help. An important axiom (fact) of arithmetic states that multiplication
“distributes” over addition. That is, for any three numbers, A, B and C,
A(B + C) = AB + AC.
If signed number arithmetic is to be consistent with the arithmetic of nonnegative numbers, this axiom
must continue to hold. In particular, if A and B are positive,
(−A)(B + (−B)) = (−A)(B) + (−A)(−B).
Since the left hand side equals 0 (why?) so does the right hand side. It follows that (−A)(−B) must
be the opposite of (−A)(B) = −(−AB) = AB. In other words, it must be true that (−A)(−B) = AB.]
Here is a summary of the rules for multiplying signed numbers.
When two signed numbers are multiplied
• if the numbers have the same sign, the product is positive.
• if the numbers have opposite signs, the product is negative.
In both cases, the absolute value of the product is the product of
the individual absolute values.
In the examples and exercises below, we freely use all three ways of symbolizing multiplication: ·,
×, and juxtaposition. It is easiest to determine the sign of the product ﬁrst, and then compute with
the absolute values.
Example 174. Multiply (−16) × 5.
Solution. (−16) × 5 = −80 (negative since the numbers have opposite signs).
Example 175. Find the product (−11) · (−12).
Page 147
Solution. (−11) · (−12) = 132 (positive since the numbers have the same signs).
Example 176. Find the product (−6.30)(−2.05).
Solution. The product is positive since the numbers have the same sign.
Temporarily ignoring the
decimal points,
6 3 0
×
2 0 5
3 1 5 0
1 2 6 0
1 2 9 1 5 0
Inserting four decimal places counting from the right, and remembering that the product is positive, we
conclude that
(−6.30)(−2.05) = 12.915.

Recall the zero property, which states that
0 · x = 0
and
x · 0 = 0,
for any number x.
This remains true for signed numbers.
Example 179. (−17.1) · 0 = 0.
Also, 1 continues to be the multiplicative identity , that is,
1 · x = x
and
x · 1 = x,
for any number x.

Page 148
Multiplication, like addition, continues to be associative when extended to signed numbers. Thus
we can multiply several signed numbers without worrying how we group them for multiplication. One
consequence is that the sign of a product of several signed numbers can be quickly determined in advance
by simply determining whether the number of negative factors is even or odd.
The sign of a product of several factors is
• positive if the number of negative factors is even,
• negative if the number of negative factors is odd.
This is true because every pair of negative factors has a positive product. If there is an even number
of negative factors, they can be “paired oﬀ” (in any convenient order), producing a product of positive
numbers which is, of course, positive. But if the number of negative factors is odd, there is always one
“unpaired” negative factor, which makes the total product negative.
Example 181.
(−1)(2)(−3)(−4) = −24
(an odd number (three) of negative factors makes a negative product),
(−1)(−2)(−3)(−4) = 24
(an even number (four) of negative factors makes a positive product).

Dividing Signed Numbers
Recall that two numbers are reciprocal if their product is 1. We extend this deﬁnition unchanged to
signed numbers. For example, since
(−2) ×
�
−1
2
�
= 1,
−2 and −1
2 are reciprocal. Similarly, −3
8 and −8
3 are reciprocal, since
�
−3
8
��
−8
3
�
= 1.
Division by a signed number N ̸= 0 can then be deﬁned (as with positive numbers) as multiplication
by the reciprocal of N, i.e.,
M ÷ N = M · 1
N
for any number M. Since a number and its reciprocal must have the same sign (why?), it follows that
the rules for dividing signed numbers are exactly analogous to the rules for multiplying them.
When two signed numbers are divided (and the divisor is nonzero)
• if the dividend and divisor have the same sign, the quotient
is positive
• if the dividend and the divisor have opposite signs, the quo-
tient is negative.
In both cases, the absolute value of the quotient is the quotient of
the individual absolute values.
Page 150
Recall that a fraction bar indicates division, that is, x
y = x ÷ y. By the rule for division of signed
numbers, if either x or y (but not both) is negative, the fraction represents a negative number. For
example, suppose a, b and c are positive. Then
−a
b = a
−b = −a
b.
All three fractions are equivalent, but it is customary to avoid the form in the middle (with a negative
number in the denominator). In the examples and exercises, we indicate division by the ÷ symbol or
the fraction bar interchangeably. It is easiest to determine the sign ﬁrst, and then compute with the
absolute values. For divisions of whole numbers, explicit conversion to reciprocal multiplication is not
necessary.
Example 182. Divide 24 by −6.
Solution. The quotient 24÷(−6) is negative since the numbers have opposite signs. The absolute value
is 24 ÷ 6 = 4. Thus
24 ÷ (−6) = −4.
Example 183. Express the fraction −33
5
as a mixed number.
Solution. The fraction represents division of numbers with opposite signs, so the result is negative. For
the division 33 ÷ 5, the quotient is 6 and the remainder is 3, so
−33
5
= −63

Solution. The quotient is negative because the numbers have opposite signs. Thus
3.738 ÷ (−100) = −0.03738.
(Recall that dividing a decimal by a power of 10 (102 in this case) simply results in a leftward shift of
the decimal point by a number of places equal to the exponent on 10.)
Example 186. Divide 16 ÷ (−0.25).
Solution. The quotient is negative because the signs are opposite. We can either perform the long
division
0.25)16
equivalent to
25)1600,
or convert 0.25 to the fraction 1
4 and multiply by its reciprocal. The latter seems easier:

5.4.1
Division and 0
Recall that 0 can be the numerator of a fraction, but it cannot be the denominator. This remains
true for signed fractions. Fractions are divisions, and conversely, every division can be represented as a
fraction. A fraction like
0
−3 makes sense and is equal to 0, so
0 ÷ (−3) = 0
−3 = −0
3 = −0 = 0.
But the fraction −3
0 , and therefore the division (−3) ÷ 0, is undeﬁned. (You may wish to review the
discussion in Section 2.2.1, where all attempts to make sense of a fraction with denominator 0 led to
failure or contradiction.) We summarize the properties of 0 with respect to division.
For a nonzero signed number N
•
0 ÷ N = 0
•
N ÷ 0 is undeﬁned.
0 ÷ 0 is also undeﬁned.
Example 187. 0 ÷ (−23) and
0
−71 are both equal to 0.
1.62 ÷ 0 and −16
0
are undeﬁned.

Powers of Signed Numbers
Since exponents indicate repeated multiplication, there is no problem applying exponents to signed
numbers.
(−4)3 = (−4)(−4)(−4) = −64
and
(−2)4 = (−2)(−2)(−2)(−2) = 16.

Solution. (−0.2)4 = (−0.2)(−0.2)(−0.2)(−0.2) = 0.0016. (The product of four negative factors is
positive.)
The previous examples show that
A power of a negative number is
• negative if the exponent is odd,
• positive if the exponent is even.
When applying exponents to signed numbers, it is essential to put parentheses around the number,
including its sign. For example, the square of −3 is written
(−3)2 = (−3)(−3) = 9.
Without parentheses, as in
−32,
the exponent applies only to 3, not to −3, and this is not a power of −3. Rather, −32 represents the
opposite of 32, so
−32 = −9.

The behavior of 0 in an exponential expression, in particular, the interpretation of 0 as an exponent,

Square Roots and Signed Numbers
If there is a number whose square is the number n, it is called a square root of n. For example, since
42 = 16, 4 is a square root of 16. It is also true that (−4)2 = 16, so −4 is another square root of 16.
Every positive number N has two square roots, which are
opposites:
• The positive square root is denoted
√
N.
• The negative square root is denoted −
√
N.
As usual, 0 is a special case. It has only one square root, itself:
√
0 = 0.
Whole numbers whose square roots are also whole numbers are called perfect squares.
Example 192. The ﬁrst few perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16 and 25, because
√
0 = 0,
√
1 = 1,
√
4 = 2,
√
9 = 3,
√
16 = 4,
and
√
25 = 5.
The square root of a whole number which is not a perfect square has a decimal expansion which
neither terminates nor repeats. (Such numbers are called irrational.) A calculator will inform you that
√
2 ≈ 1.41
and
√
3 ≈ 1.73
(rounded to the nearest hundredth).
Example 193. Between what two whole numbers do −

√
3 lie? Which number is larger?
Solution. On the number line, −
√
2 ≈ −1.41 and −
√
3 ≈ −1.73 both lie between −1 and −2.

Example 194. Between what two integers does −
√
19 lie?
Page 156
Solution. We ﬁrst locate the largest perfect square less than 19, and the smallest perfect square greater
than 19. We ﬁnd that 19 is between 42 and 52. That is, 16 < 19 < 25. It follows (by a geometric
argument we gave in Section 1.4.3) that
4 <
√
19 < 5.
This relationship has a “mirror image” on the negative half of the number line, as indicated below.

√
19 is greater than −5 and less than
−4,
−5 < −
√
19 < −4.
The square root of a positive fraction is not usually a quotient of whole numbers. The exceptions
occur when the numerator and denominator of the fraction are both perfect squares. For example,
�
4
9 = 2
3 because
�2
3
�2
= 4
9. But
�
2
5 cannot be evaluated in this way. We can, however, write
�
2
5 =
√
2
√
5
(since
�√
2
√
5
�2
= 2
5).
This expresses
�
2
5 as a quotient, but not a quotient of whole numbers.
We come now to a troubling fact.
Square roots of negative numbers cannot be
deﬁned within the system of signed numbers.
Suppose, for example, there were a number which, when squared, yields −4. That number must have
absolute value 2, so the only possibilities are 2 and −2. But
22 = (−2)2 = 4
(not −4).
A similar argument applies to any negative number. It is possible to expand the set of signed numbers
so as to remedy this defect. This involves adjoining some “imaginary” (as opposed to “real”) numbers.
We leave that for a more advanced course. For now, when we encounter the square root of a negative
number, we simply say that it is not a real number.
Example 195. √−5 is not a real number.

Evaluating Expressions
A mathematical expression is any meaningful combination of numbers, letters, operation symbols (such
as +, −, ×, ÷, √ ), and grouping symbols (such as parentheses, brackets, fraction bars and the extended
square root symbol like √
). For example, the expression
x + y
x − y
Page 158
indicates a fraction whose numerator is the sum of two unspeciﬁed numbers, x and y, and whose
denominator is their diﬀerence. Letters in a mathematical expression are called variables because they
represent unspeciﬁed numbers that can take various diﬀerent values. Expressions can be evaluated
(assigned a numerical value) if numerical values are assigned to all the variables appearing in the
expression.
Example 196. Evaluate the expression x + y
x − y if x = 2 and y = −6.
Solution. We replace each letter by its assigned numerical value, enclosed in parentheses,
x + y
x − y = (2) + (−6)
(2) − (−6),
and simplify the resulting expression
(2) + (−6)
(2) − (−6) = −4
8 = −1
2.
Assigning diﬀerent values to the letters in an expression usually changes the value of the expression.
Example 197. Evaluate the expression x + y
x − y if x = −3 and y = 3.
Solution. Replacing x and y by their assigned values,
x + y
x − y = (−3) + (3)
(−3) − (3) = 0
−6 = 0.
The reason for replacing letters with their assigned values in parentheses is to avoid pitfalls such as
the ones highlighted in the next two examples.
Example 198. Evaluate x2 if x = −4.
Solution. Forgetting parentheses, we would write x2 = −42 = −16, which is wrong, since the square of
any nonzero number is positive. The correct evaluation is
x2 = (−4)2 = 16.
Example 199. Evaluate ab if a = 3 and b = −4.
Solution. Without parentheses, we might think ab = 3−4 = −1, mistakenly turning multiplication into
subtraction. The correct evaluation is
ab = (3)(−4) = −12.
To evaluate complicated expressions consistently, we must follow the order of operations, which is
restated below for convenience.
Page 159
1. operations within grouping symbols ﬁrst;
2. exponents and roots next;
3. multiplications and divisions (in order of appearance) next;
4. additions and subtractions (in order of appearance) last.
Recall that “in order of appearance” means in order from left to right, and that grouping symbols
include parentheses, brackets, braces (curly brackets), the square root symbol, and the fraction bar.
Example 200. Evaluate the expression x − 3y if x = 4 and y = −1

Using Formulae
A formula expresses one quantity in terms of others. For example, the formula for the area A of a
rectangle of length l and width w is
A = lw.
If we know the length and width of a rectangle, we can calculate its area, using the formula.
For
example, the area of a rectangle of width 17 feet and length 50 feet is
A = lw = (17)(50) = 850 square feet.
Example 205. The formula for the distance s (in feet) that an object falls in a time t (in seconds) is
s = 16t2.
Use the formula to determine the distance an object falls in (a) 2 seconds; (b) 4 seconds.
Solution. We substitute t = 2 and t = 4 into the formula. In 2 seconds the object falls
s = 16(2)2 = 64 feet,
while, in 4 seconds it falls
s = 16(4)2 = 256 feet.
Example 206. The formula which converts temperature in degrees Celsius (◦C) to temperature in
degrees Fahrenheit (◦F) is
F = 9

Find the temperature in ◦F if a thermometer reads −10◦C.

s = 1
2(a + b + c).
Find the semi-perimeter of a triangle with side lengths a = 6 ft 8 in, b = 9 ft 4 in, and c = 11 ft 10 in.
Solution. We convert all measurements to inches, using the fact that 1 ft = 12 in. Thus
a = 80 in,
b = 112 in,
and
c = 142 in.
The semi-perimeter is
s = 1

C =

Linear Equations in One Variable
An equation is a statement that two mathematical expressions are equal. If the statement has just one
variable, and if
• the variable does not appear in the denominator of a fraction,
• the variable does not appear under a √ symbol,
• the variable is not raised to a power other than 1,
then we have a linear equation in one variable. Here are some examples of linear equations in one
variable:
2x + 4 = 8
− 3y = 12
z − 9 = −1
2 − 2
3t = 0.
A solution to an equation in one variable is a number which, when substituted for the variable, makes
a true statement.
Example 210. Show that −4 is a solution to the equation −3y = 12
Solution. When we substitute −4 for y in the equation, we get
−3(−4) = 12
12 = 12,
a true statement.
Page 164
Example 211. Show that 10 is not a solution to the equation z − 9 = −1.
Solution. When we substitute 10 for z in the equation, we get
10 − 9 = −1
−1 = 1,
a false statement.
Example 212. Show that 3 is a solution to the equation 2 − 2
3t = 0, but 4 is not.
Solution. When we substitute 3 for t, we obtain
2 − 2

Here is the formal deﬁnition of the subject of this section.
A linear equation in one variable x is an equation that can
be written in the form
ax + b = c
for some numbers a, b and c, with a ̸= 0.
Such an equation always has a unique (i.e., exactly one) solution.
5.9.1
Finding solutions
We ﬁnd solutions to equations using two common-sense principles:
• Adding equals to equals produces equals,
• Multiplying equals by equals produces equals.
Page 165
For example, 2 and 2 are equals, and so are 3 and 3. Adding equals to equals,
2 = 2
3 = 3
2 + 3 = 2 + 3
produces equals: 5 = 5.
Consider the linear equation
x − 3 = 6.
Although we cannot say that x − 3 and 6 are “equals” (without knowing the value of x) we can say
that if they are equal for some x, then adding equals to both sides, or multiplying both sides by equals,
will produce a new pair of equals for the same x. In particular, if x − 3 = 6 is true for some x, so is the
equation obtained by adding 3 to both sides:
x − 3 = 6
+3
+3
x = 9.
The solution to the last equation is obvious (and obviously unique): x must be 9. It is slightly less
obvious that 9 is a solution of the original equation. Could there be some other solution to the original
equation, say, x = p? If so, then p −3 = 6, and adding 3 to both sides yields p = 9. So p is no diﬀerent
from the solution we already found. We conclude that 9 is the unique solution of x − 3 = 6.
Example 213. Find the solution of the equation 9 = −1
5z by multiplying both sides by equals. Check
that you have indeed obtained the unique solution.
Solution. If we multiply both sides of the equation by −5, we get
−5(9) = −5
�
−1

�
z
−45 = z.
To check that −45 is the solution, substitute −45 for z in the original equation, and verify that a true
statement results.

a true statement.
Equations which have the same solution are called equivalent. As the previous examples show, a
strategy for ﬁnding the solution of an equation is to systematically transform it into simpler equivalent
equations, until we arrive at an equation like x = 8, or −45 = z, whose solution is obvious.
Page 166
To ﬁnd the solution (solve) a linear equation in one variable,
we can do one or both of the following:
• add the same number to both sides of the equation;
• multiply both sides of the equation by the same non-
zero number.
We can replace “add” by “subtract,” and “multiply” by “divide,” if convenient.
(This is because
subtracting a number is the same as adding the opposite number, and dividing by a nonzero number is
the same as multiplying by the reciprocal number.)
Example 214. Solve the equation 2x + 4 = −10 and check that the solution is correct.
Solution. First subtract 4 from both sides:
2x + 4 = −10
−4
−4
2x = −14.
Then divide both sides by 2:

x = −7.
The solution is −7. To check, we substitute −7 for x in the original equation, and see if a true statement
results.
2x + 4 = −10
2(−7) + 4 ?= −10
−14 + 4 ?= −10
−10 = −10
a true statement
Example 215. Solve the equation 26 = 5 − 7
8x and check the solution.
Solution. At some point it will be necessary to multiply both sides by the reciprocal of −7
8. But it is
better not to do that immediately. If we ﬁrst subtract 5 from both sides, the computations are shorter.

A linear equation given in the standard form
ax + b = c
(a ̸= 0)
is solved in two steps: ﬁrst, subtract b from both sides; second, divide both sides by a.
Example 216. Solve the equation −x + 5 = 12.
Solution. Note that −x means −1x. Following the two step procedure, we ﬁrst subtract 5 from both
sides, and then divide both sides by −1.
−x + 5 = 12
−x = 7
(subtracting 5 from both sides)
x = −7
(dividing or multiplying both sides by −1)
Note that dividing by −1 is the same as multiplying by −1, since −1 is its own reciprocal!
Example 217. Solve 3x + 1
2 = 1
2.
Solution. We ﬁrst subtract 1
2 from both sides.
3x + 1
2 = 1
2
3x = 1
2 − 1
2
3x = 0
x = 0.
At the last step, we divided both sides by 3. Recall that 0
3 = 0.
Example 218. Four times a number is −5.6. What is the number?
Solution. Let x represent the unknown number. The sentence “Four times a number is −5.6” is a
verbal form of the equation
4x = −5.6.
Dividing both sides by 4 yields
x = −5.6
4
= −1.4.
The number is −1.4. It is straightforward to check that four times −1.4 is indeed −5.6.
