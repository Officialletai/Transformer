Pre-Algebra - Integers
Objective: Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide Positive and Negative
Numbers.
The ability to work comfortably with negative numbers is essential to success in
algebra. For this reason we will do a quick review of adding, subtracting, multi-
plying and dividing of integers. Integers are all the positive whole numbers, zero,
and their opposites (negatives). As this is intended to be a review of integers, the
descriptions and examples will not be as detailed as a normal lesson.
World View Note: The ﬁrst set of rules for working with negative numbers was
written out by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupa.
When adding integers we have two cases to consider. The ﬁrst is if the signs
match, both positive or both negative. If the signs match we will add the num-
bers together and keep the sign. This is illustrated in the following examples
Example 1.
− 5 + ( − 3)
Same sign, add 5 + 3, keep the negative
− 8
Our Solution
Example 2.
− 7 + ( − 5)
Same sign, add 7 + 5, keep the negative
− 12
Our Solution
If the signs don’t match, one positive and one negative number, we will subtract
the numbers (as if they were all positive) and then use the sign from the larger
number. This means if the larger number is positive, the answer is positive. If the
larger number is negative, the answer is negative. This is shown in the following
examples.
Example 3.
− 7 + 2
Diﬀerent signs, subtract 7 − 2, use sign from bigger number, negative
− 5
Our Solution
Example 4.
− 4 + 6
Diﬀerent signs, subtract 6 − 4, use sign from bigger number, positive
2
Our Solution
7
Example 5.
4 + ( − 3)
Diﬀerent signs, subtract 4 − 3, use sign from bigger number, positive
1
Our Solution
Example 6.
7 + ( − 10)
Diﬀerent signs, subtract 10 − 7, use sign from bigger number, negative
− 3
Our Solution
For subtraction of negatives we will change the problem to an addition problem
which we can then solve using the above methods. The way we change a subtrac-
tion to an addition is to add the opposite of the number after the subtraction
sign. Often this method is refered to as “add the opposite.” This is illustrated in
the following examples.
Example 7.
8 − 3
Add the opposite of 3
8 + ( − 3)
Diﬀerent signs, subtract 8 − 3, use sign from bigger number, positive
5
Our Solution
Example 8.
− 4 − 6
Add the opposite of 6
− 4 + ( − 6)
Same sign, add 4 + 6, keep the negative
− 10
Our Solution
Example 9.
9 − ( − 4)
Add the opposite of − 4
9 + 4
Same sign, add 9 + 4, keep the positive
13
Our Solution
Example 10.
− 6 − ( − 2)
Add the opposite of − 2
− 6 + 2
Diﬀerent sign, subtract 6 − 2, use sign from bigger number, negative
− 4
Our Solution
8
Multiplication and division of integers both work in a very similar pattern. The
short description of the process is we multiply and divide like normal, if the signs
match (both positive or both negative) the answer is positive. If the signs don’t
match (one positive and one negative) then the answer is negative. This is shown
in the following examples
Example 11.
(4)( − 6)
Signs do not match, answer is negative
− 24
Our Solution
Example 12.
− 36
− 9
Signs match, answer is positive
4
Our Solution
Example 13.
− 2( − 6)
Signs match, answer is positive
12
Our Solution
Example 14.
15
− 3
Signs do not match, answer is negative
− 5
Our Solution
A few things to be careful of when working with integers. First be sure not to
confuse a problem like − 3 − 8 with − 3( − 8). The second problem is a multipli-
cation problem because there is nothing between the 3 and the parenthesis. If
there is no operation written in between the parts, then we assume that means we
are multiplying. The − 3 − 8 problem, is subtraction because the subtraction sep-
arates the 3 from what comes after it. Another item to watch out for is to be
careful not to mix up the pattern for adding and subtracting integers with the
pattern for multiplying and dividing integers. They can look very similar, for
example if the signs match on addition, the we keep the negative, − 3 + ( − 7) = −
10, but if the signs match on multiplication, the answer is positive, ( − 3)( − 7) =

Pre-Algebra - Fractions
Objective: Reduce, add, subtract, multiply, and divide with fractions.
Working with fractions is a very important foundation to algebra. Here we will
brieﬂy review reducing, multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions.
As this is a review, concepts will not be explained in detail as other lessons are.
World View Note: The earliest known use of fraction comes from the Middle
Kingdom of Egypt around 2000 BC!
We always like our ﬁnal answers when working with fractions to be reduced.
Reducing fractions is simply done by dividing both the numerator and denomi-
nator by the same number. This is shown in the following example
Example 15.
36
84
Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4
36 ÷ 4
84 ÷ 4 = 9
21
Both numerator and denominator are still divisible by 3
12
9 ÷ 3
21 ÷ 3 = 3
7
Our Soultion
The previous example could have been done in one step by dividing both numer-
ator and denominator by 12. We also could have divided by 2 twice and then
divided by 3 once (in any order). It is not important which method we use as
long as we continue reducing our fraction until it cannot be reduced any further.
The easiest operation with fractions is multiplication. We can multiply fractions
by multiplying straight across, multiplying numerators together and denominators
together.
Example 16.
6
7 · 3
5
Multiply numerators across and denominators across
18
35
Our Solution
When multiplying we can reduce our fractions before we multiply. We can either
reduce vertically with a single fraction, or diagonally with several fractions, as
long as we use one number from the numerator and one number from the denomi-
nator.
Example 17.
25
24 · 32
55
Reduce 25 and 55 by dividing by 5. Reduce 32 and 24 by dividing by 8
5
3 · 4
11
Multiply numerators across and denominators across
20
33
Our Solution
Dividing fractions is very similar to multiplying with one extra step. Dividing
fractions requires us to ﬁrst take the reciprocal of the second fraction and mul-
tiply. Once we do this, the multiplication problem solves just as the previous
problem.
13
Example 18.
21
16 ÷ 28
6
Multiply by the reciprocal
21
16 · 6
28
Reduce 21 and 28 by dividing by 7. Reduce 6 and 16 by dividing by 2
3
8 · 3
4
Multiply numerators across and denominators across
9
32
Our Soultion
To add and subtract fractions we will ﬁrst have to ﬁnd the least common denomi-
nator (LCD). There are several ways to ﬁnd an LCD. One way is to ﬁnd the
smallest multiple of the largest denominator that you can also divide the small
denomiator by.
Example 19.
Find the LCD of 8 and 12
Test multiples of 12
12? 12
8
Can′t divide 12 by 8
24? 24
8 = 3
Yes! We can divide 24 by 8!
24
Our Soultion
Adding and subtracting fractions is identical in process. If both fractions already
have a common denominator we just add or subtract the numerators and keep the
denominator.
Example 20.
7
8 + 3
8
Same denominator, add numerators 7 + 3
10
8
Reduce answer, dividing by 2
5
4
Our Solution
While 5
4 can be written as the mixed number 1 1
4, in algebra we will almost never
use mixed numbers. For this reason we will always use the improper fraction, not
the mixed number.
14
Example 21.
13
6 − 9
6
Same denominator, subtract numerators 13 − 9
4
6
Reduce answer, dividing by 2
2
3
Our Solution
If the denominators do not match we will ﬁrst have to identify the LCD and build
up each fraction by multiplying the numerators and denominators by the same
number so the denominator is built up to the LCD.
Example 22.
5
6 + 4
9
LCD is 18.
3 · 5
3 · 6 + 4 · 2
9 · 2
Multiply ﬁrst fraction by 3 and the second by 2
15
18 + 8
18
Same denominator, add numerators, 15 + 8

Our Solution
Example 23.

Pre-Algebra - Order of Operations
Objective: Evaluate expressions using the order of operations, including
the use of absolute value.
When simplifying expressions it is important that we simplify them in the correct
order. Consider the following problem done two diﬀerent ways:
Example 24.
2 + 5 · 3 Add First
2 + 5 · 3 Multiply
7 · 3
Multiply
2 + 15
Add
21
Solution
17
Solution
The previous example illustrates that if the same problem is done two diﬀerent
ways we will arrive at two diﬀerent solutions. However, only one method can be
correct. It turns out the second method, 17, is the correct method. The order of
operations ends with the most basic of operations, addition (or subtraction).
Before addition is completed we must do repeated addition or multiplication (or
division). Before multiplication is completed we must do repeated multiplication
or exponents. When we want to do something out of order and make it come ﬁrst
we will put it in parenthesis (or grouping symbols). This list then is our order of
operations we will use to simplify expressions.
Order of Operations:
Parenthesis (Grouping)
Exponents
Multiply and Divide (Left to Right)
Add and Subtract (Left to Right)
Multiply and Divide are on the same level because they are the same operation
(division is just multiplying by the reciprocal). This means they must be done left
to right, so some problems we will divide ﬁrst, others we will multiply ﬁrst. The
same is true for adding and subtracting (subtracting is just adding the opposite).
Often students use the word PEMDAS to remember the order of operations, as
the ﬁrst letter of each operation creates the word PEMDAS. However, it is the
author’s suggestion to think about PEMDAS as a vertical word written as:
P
E
MD
AS
so we don’t forget that multiplication and division are done left to right (same
with addition and subtraction). Another way students remember the order of
operations is to think of a phrase such as “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally”
where each word starts with the same letters as the order of operations start with.
World View Note: The ﬁrst use of grouping symbols are found in 1646 in the
Dutch mathematician, Franciscus van Schooten’s text, Vieta. He used a bar over
18
the expression that is to be evaluated ﬁrst. So problems like 2(3 + 5) were written
as 2 · 3 + 5.
Example 25.
2 + 3(9 − 4)2
Parenthesis ﬁrst
2 + 3(5)2
Exponents
2 + 3(25)
Multiply
2 + 75
Add
77
Our Solution
It is very important to remember to multiply and divide from from left to right!
Example 26.
30 ÷ 3 · 2
Divide ﬁrst (left to right!)
10 · 2
Multiply
20
Our Solution
In the previous example, if we had multiplied ﬁrst, ﬁve would have been the
answer which is incorrect.
If there are several parenthesis in a problem we will start with the inner most
parenthesis and work our way out. Inside each parenthesis we simplify using the
order of operations as well. To make it easier to know which parenthesis goes with
which parenthesis, diﬀerent types of parenthesis will be used such as { } and [ ]
and ( ), these parenthesis all mean the same thing, they are parenthesis and must
be evaluated ﬁrst.
Example 27.
2{82 − 7[32 − 4(32
˜ + 1)]( − 1)}
Inner most parenthesis, exponents ﬁrst
2{82 − 7[32 − 4(9 + 1)]( − 1)}
Add inside those parenthesis
2{82 − 7[32− 4(10)]( − 1)}
Multiply inside inner most parenthesis
2{82 − 7[32 − 40]( − 1)}
Subtract inside those parenthesis
2{82
˜ − 7[ − 8]( − 1)}

Our Solution
As the above example illustrates, it can take several steps to complete a problem.
The key to successfully solve order of operations problems is to take the time to
show your work and do one step at a time. This will reduce the chance of making
a mistake along the way.

There are several types of grouping symbols that can be used besides parenthesis.
One type is a fraction bar. If we have a fraction, the entire numerator and the
entire denominator must be evaluated before we reduce the fraction. In these
cases we can simplify in both the numerator and denominator at the same time.
Example 28.
24˜ − ( − 8) · 3
15 ÷ 5 − 1
Exponent in the numerator, divide in denominator
16 − ( − 8) · 3
3 − 1
Multiply in the numerator, subtract in denominator
16 − ( − 24)
2
Add the opposite to simplify numerator, denominator is done.

Reduce, divide
20
Our Solution
Another type of grouping symbol that also has an operation with it, absolute
value. When we have absolute value we will evaluate everything inside the abso-
lute value, just as if it were a normal parenthesis. Then once the inside is com-
pleted we will take the absolute value, or distance from zero, to make the number
positive.
Example 29.
1 + 3| − 42
˜ − ( − 8)| + 2|3 + ( − 5)2|
Evaluate absolute values ﬁrst, exponents
1 + 3|− 16 − ( − 8)| + 2|3 + 25|
Add inside absolute values
1 + 3| − 8| + 2|28|
Evaluate absolute values
1 + 3(8) + 2(28)
Multiply left to right
1 + 24 + 2(28)
Finish multiplying
1 + 24 + 56
Add left to right
25 + 56
Add
81
Our Solution
The above example also illustrates an important point about exponents. Expo-
nents only are considered to be on the number they are attached to. This means
when we see − 42, only the 4 is squared, giving us − (42) or − 16. But when the
negative is in parentheses, such as ( − 5)2 the negative is part of the number and
is also squared giving us a positive solution, 25.

Pre-Algebra - Properties of Algebra
Objective: Simplify algebraic expressions by substituting given values,
distributing, and combining like terms
In algebra we will often need to simplify an expression to make it easier to use.
There are three basic forms of simplifying which we will review here.
World View Note: The term “Algebra” comes from the Arabic word al-jabr
which means “reunion”. It was ﬁrst used in Iraq in 830 AD by Mohammad ibn-
Musa al-Khwarizmi.
The ﬁrst form of simplifying expressions is used when we know what number each
variable in the expression represents. If we know what they represent we can
replace each variable with the equivalent number and simplify what remains using
order of operations.
Example 30.
p(q + 6) when p = 3 and q = 5
Replace p with 3 and q with 5
(3)((5) + 6)
Evaluate parenthesis
(3)(11)
Multiply
33
Our Solution
Whenever a variable is replaced with something, we will put the new number
inside a set of parenthesis. Notice the 3 and 5 in the previous example are in
parenthesis. This is to preserve operations that are sometimes lost in a simple
replacement. Sometimes the parenthesis won’t make a diﬀerence, but it is a good
habbit to always use them to prevent problems later.
Example 31.
x + zx(3 − z)
� x
3
�
when x = − 6 and z = − 2
Replace all x′s with 6 and z′s with 2
( − 6) + ( − 2)( − 6)(3 − ( − 2))
� ( − 6)
3
�
Evaluate parenthesis
− 6 + ( − 2)( − 6)(5)( − 2)
Multiply left to right
− 6 + 12(5)( − 2)
Multiply left to right
− 6 + 60( − 2)
Multiply
− 6 − 120
Subtract
− 126
Our Solution
22
It will be more common in our study of algebra that we do not know the value of
the variables. In this case, we will have to simplify what we can and leave the
variables in our ﬁnal solution. One way we can simplify expressions is to combine
like terms. Like terms are terms where the variables match exactly (exponents
included). Examples of like terms would be 3xy and − 7xy or 3a2b and 8a2b or −
3 and 5. If we have like terms we are allowed to add (or subtract) the numbers in
front of the variables, then keep the variables the same. This is shown in the fol-
lowing examples
Example 32.
5x − 2y − 8x + 7y
Combine like terms 5x − 8x and − 2y + 7y
− 3x + 5y
Our Solution
Example 33.
8x2 − 3x + 7 − 2x2 + 4x − 3
Combine like terms 8x2 − 2x2 and − 3x + 4x and 7 − 3
6x2 + x + 4
Our Solution
As we combine like terms we need to interpret subtraction signs as part of the fol-
lowing term. This means if we see a subtraction sign, we treat the following term
like a negative term, the sign always stays with the term.
A ﬁnal method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with prob-
lems there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem diﬃcult, if not
impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive
property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis
by each term inside of the parenthesis.
Distributive Property: a(b + c) = ab + ac
Several examples of using the distributive property are given below.
Example 34.
4(2x − 7)
Multiply each term by 4
8x − 28
Our Solution
Example 35.
− 7(5x − 6)
Multiply each term by − 7
− 35 + 42
Our Solution
In the previous example we again use the fact that the sign goes with the number,
this means we treat the − 6 as a negative number, this gives ( − 7)( − 6) = 42, a
positive number. The most common error in distributing is a sign error, be very
careful with your signs!
23
It is possible to distribute just a negative through parenthesis. If we have a nega-
tive in front of parenthesis we can think of it like a − 1 in front and distribute the
− 1 through. This is shown in the following example.
Example 36.
− (4x − 5y + 6)
Negative can be thought of as − 1
− 1(4x − 5y + 6)
Multiply each term by − 1
− 4x + 5y − 6
Our Solution
Distributing through parenthesis and combining like terms can be combined into
one problem. Order of operations tells us to multiply (distribute) ﬁrst then add or
subtract last (combine like terms). Thus we do each problem in two steps, dis-
tribute then combine.
Example 37.
5 + 3(2x − 4)
Distribute 3, multipling each term
5 + 6x − 12
Combine like terms 5 − 12
− 7 + 6x
Our Solution
Example 38.
3x − 2(4x − 5)
Distribute − 2, multilpying each term
3x − 8x + 10
Combine like terms 3x − 8x
− 5x + 10
Our Solution
In the previous example we distributed − 2, not just 2. This is because we will
always treat subtraction like a negative sign that goes with the number after it.
This makes a big diﬀerence when we multiply by the − 5 inside the parenthesis,
we now have a positive answer. Following are more involved examples of dis-
tributing and combining like terms.
Example 39.
2(5x − 8) − 6(4x + 3)
Distribute 2 into ﬁrst parenthesis and − 6 into second
10x − 16 − 24x − 18
Combine like terms 10x − 24x and − 16 − 18
− 14x − 34
Our Solution
Example 40.
4(3x − 8) − (2x − 7)
Negative (subtract) in middle can be thought of as − 1
4(3x − 8) − 1(2x − 7)
Distribute 4 into ﬁrst parenthesis, − 1 into second
12x − 32 − 2x + 7
Combine like terms 12x − 2x and − 32 + 7
10x − 25
Our Solution

Solving Linear Equations - One Step Equations
Objective: Solve one step linear equations by balancing using inverse
operations
Solving linear equations is an important and fundamental skill in algebra. In
algebra, we are often presented with a problem where the answer is known, but
part of the problem is missing. The missing part of the problem is what we seek
to ﬁnd. An example of such a problem is shown below.
Example 41.
4x + 16 = − 4
Notice the above problem has a missing part, or unknown, that is marked by x. If
we are given that the solution to this equation is − 5, it could be plugged into the
equation, replacing the x with − 5. This is shown in Example 2.
Example 42.
4( − 5) + 16 = − 4
Multiply 4( − 5)
− 20 + 16 = − 4
Add − 20 + 16
− 4 = − 4
True!
Now the equation comes out to a true statement! Notice also that if another
number, for example, 3, was plugged in, we would not get a true statement as
seen in Example 3.
Example 43.
4(3) + 16 = − 4
Multiply 4(3)
12 + 16 = − 4
Add 12 + 16
28
� − 4
False!
Due to the fact that this is not a true statement, this demonstates that 3 is not
the solution. However, depending on the complexity of the problem, this “guess
and check” method is not very eﬃcient. Thus, we take a more algebraic approach
to solving equations. Here we will focus on what are called “one-step equations” or
equations that only require one step to solve. While these equations often seem
very fundamental, it is important to master the pattern for solving these problems
so we can solve more complex problems.
28
Addition Problems
To solve equations, the general rule is to do the opposite. For example, consider
the following example.
Example 44.
x + 7 = − 5
The 7 is added to the x
− 7
− 7
Subtract 7 from both sides to get rid of it
x = − 12
Our solution!
Then we get our solution, x = − 12. The same process is used in each of the fol-
lowing examples.
Example 45.
4 + x = 8
− 4
− 4
x = 4
7 = x + 9
− 9
− 9
− 2 = x
5 = 8 + x
− 8 − 8
− 3 = x
Table 1. Addition Examples
Subtraction Problems
In a subtraction problem, we get rid of negative numbers by adding them to both
sides of the equation. For example, consider the following example.
Example 46.
x − 5 = 4
The 5 is negative, or subtracted from x
+ 5 + 5
Add 5 to both sides
x = 9
Our Solution!
Then we get our solution x = 9. The same process is used in each of the following
examples. Notice that each time we are getting rid of a negative number by
adding.
29
Example 47.
− 6 + x = − 2
+ 6
+ 6
x = 4
− 10 = x − 7
+ 7
+ 7
− 3 = x
5 = − 8 + x
+ 8 + 8
13 = x
Table 2. Subtraction Examples
Multiplication Problems
With a multiplication problem, we get rid of the number by dividing on both
sides. For example consider the following example.
Example 48.
4x = 20
Variable is multiplied by 4
4
4
Divide both sides by 4
x = 5
Our solution!
Then we get our solution x = 5
With multiplication problems it is very important that care is taken with signs. If
x is multiplied by a negative then we will divide by a negative. This is shown in
example 9.
Example 49.
− 5x = 30
Variable is multiplied by − 5
− 5
− 5
Divide both sides by − 5
x = − 6
Our Solution!
The same process is used in each of the following examples. Notice how negative
and positive numbers are handled as each problem is solved.
Example 50.
30
8x = − 24
8

x = − 3
− 4x = − 20
− 4
− 4
x = 5
42 = 7x

6 = x
Table 3. Multiplication Examples
Division Problems:
In division problems, we get rid of the denominator by multiplying on both sides.
For example consider our next example.
Example 51.
x
5 = − 3
Variable is divided by 5
(5)x
5 = − 3(5)
Multiply both sides by 5
x = − 15
Our Solution!
Then we get our solution x = − 15. The same process is used in each of the fol-
lowing examples.
Example 52.
x
− 7 = − 2
( − 7) x
− 7 = − 2( − 7)
x = 14
x
8 = 5
(8) x
8 = 5(8)
x = 40
x
− 4 = 9
( − 4) x
− 4 = 9( − 4)
x = − 36
Table 4. Division Examples
The process described above is fundamental to solving equations. once this pro-
cess is mastered, the problems we will see have several more steps. These prob-
lems may seem more complex, but the process and patterns used will remain the
same.
World View Note: The study of algebra originally was called the “Cossic Art”
from the Latin, the study of “things” (which we now call variables).

Linear Equations - Two-Step Equations
Objective: Solve two-step equations by balancing and using inverse
opperations.
After mastering the technique for solving equations that are simple one-step equa-
tions, we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we solve two-step equa-
tions, the important thing to remember is that everything works backwards!
When working with one-step equations, we learned that in order to clear a “plus
ﬁve” in the equation, we would subtract ﬁve from both sides. We learned that to
clear “divided by seven” we multiply by seven on both sides. The same pattern
applies to the order of operations. When solving for our variable x, we use order
of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or subtract ﬁrst, then
multiply or divide second (then exponents, and ﬁnally any parentheses or
grouping symbols, but that’s another lesson). So to solve the equation in the ﬁrst
example,
Example 53.
4x − 20 = − 8
We have two numbers on the same side as the x. We need to move the 4 and the
20 to the other side. We know to move the four we need to divide, and to move
the twenty we will add twenty to both sides. If order of operations is done back-
wards, we will add or subtract ﬁrst. Therefore we will add 20 to both sides ﬁrst.
Once we are done with that, we will divide both sides by 4. The steps are shown
below.
4x − 20 = − 8
Start by focusing on the subtract 20
+ 20 + 20
Add 20 to both sides
4x
= 12
Now we focus on the 4 multiplied by x
4
4
Divide both sides by 4
x = 3
Our Solution!
Notice in our next example when we replace the x with 3
we get a true state-
ment.
4(3) − 20 = − 8
Multiply 4(3)
12 − 20 = − 8
Subtract 12 − 20
− 8 = − 8
True!
33
The same process is used to solve any two-step equations. Add or subtract ﬁrst,
then multiply or divide. Consider our next example and notice how the same pro-
cess is applied.
Example 54.
5x + 7 =

Start by focusing on the plus 7
− 7 − 7
Subtract 7 from both sides
5x

Now focus on the multiplication by 5
5
5
Divide both sides by 5
x =
0
Our Solution!
Notice the seven subtracted out completely! Many students get stuck on this
point, do not forget that we have a number for “nothing left” and that number is
zero. With this in mind the process is almost identical to our ﬁrst example.
A common error students make with two-step equations is with negative signs.
Remember the sign always stays with the number.
Consider the following
example.
Example 55.
4 − 2x = 10
Start by focusing on the positive 4
− 4
− 4
Subtract 4 from both sides
− 2x = 6
Negative (subtraction) stays on the 2x
− 2 − 2
Divide by − 2
x = − 3
Our Solution!
The same is true even if there is no coeﬃcient in front of the variable. Consider
the next example.
Example 56.
8 − x = 2
Start by focusing on the positive 8
− 8
− 8
Subtract 8 from both sides
− x = − 6
Negative (subtraction) stays on the x
− 1x = − 6
Remember, no number in front of variable means 1
34
− 1
− 1
Divide both sides by − 1
x = 6
Our Solution!
Solving two-step equations is a very important skill to master, as we study
algebra. The ﬁrst step is to add or subtract, the second is to multiply or divide.
This pattern is seen in each of the following examples.
Example 57.
− 3x + 7 = − 8
− 7 − 7
− 3x = − 15

Table 5. Two-Step Equation Examples
As problems in algebra become more complex the process covered here will
remain the same. In fact, as we solve problems like those in the next example,
each one of them will have several steps to solve, but the last two steps are a two-
step equation like we are solving here. This is why it is very important to master
two-step equations now!

Solving Linear Equations - General Equations
Objective: Solve general linear equations with variables on both sides.
Often as we are solving linear equations we will need to do some work to set them
up into a form we are familiar with solving. This section will focus on manipu-
lating an equation we are asked to solve in such a way that we can use our pat-
tern for solving two-step equations to ultimately arrive at the solution.
One such issue that needs to be addressed is parenthesis. Often the parenthesis
can get in the way of solving an otherwise easy problem. As you might expect we
can get rid of the unwanted parenthesis by using the distributive property. This is
shown in the following example. Notice the ﬁrst step is distributing, then it is
solved like any other two-step equation.
Example 59.
4(2x − 6) = 16
Distribute 4 through parenthesis
8x − 24 = 16
Focus on the subtraction ﬁrst
+ 24 + 24
Add 24 to both sides
8x = 40
Now focus on the multiply by 8
8
8
Divide both sides by 8
x = 5
Our Solution!
Often after we distribute there will be some like terms on one side of the equa-
tion. Example 2 shows distributing to clear the parenthesis and then combining
like terms next. Notice we only combine like terms on the same side of the equa-
tion. Once we have done this, our next example solves just like any other two-step
equation.
Example 60.
3(2x − 4) + 9 = 15
Distribute the 3 through the parenthesis
6x − 12 + 9 = 15
Combine like terms, − 12 + 9
6x − 3 = 15
Focus on the subtraction ﬁrst
+ 3 + 3
Add 3 to both sides
6x = 18
Now focus on multiply by 6
37
6
6
Divide both sides by 6
x = 3
Our Solution
A second type of problem that becomes a two-step equation after a bit of work is
one where we see the variable on both sides. This is shown in the following
example.
Example 61.
4x − 6 = 2x + 10
Notice here the x is on both the left and right sides of the equation. This can
make it diﬃcult to decide which side to work with. We ﬁx this by moving one of
the terms with x to the other side, much like we moved a constant term. It
doesn’t matter which term gets moved, 4x or 2x,
however, it would be the
author’s suggestion to move the smaller term (to avoid negative coeﬃcients). For
this reason we begin this problem by clearing the positive 2x by subtracting 2x
from both sides.
4x − 6 = 2x + 10
Notice the variable on both sides
− 2x
− 2x
Subtract 2x from both sides
2x − 6 = 10
Focus on the subtraction ﬁrst
+ 6 + 6
Add 6 to both sides
2x = 16
Focus on the multiplication by 2
2
2
Divide both sides by 2
x = 8
Our Solution!
The previous example shows the check on this solution. Here the solution is
plugged into the x on both the left and right sides before simplifying.
Example 62.
4(8) − 6 = 2(8) + 10
Multiply 4(8) and 2(8) ﬁrst
32 − 6 = 16 + 10
Add and Subtract
26 = 26
True!
The next example illustrates the same process with negative coeﬃcients. Notice
ﬁrst the smaller term with the variable is moved to the other side, this time by
adding because the coeﬃcient is negative.
38
Example 63.
− 3x + 9 = 6x − 27
Notice the variable on both sides, − 3x is smaller
+ 3x
+ 3x
Add 3x to both sides
9 = 9x − 27
Focus on the subtraction by 27
+ 27
+ 27
Add 27 to both sides
36 = 9x
Focus on the mutiplication by 9
9
9
Divide both sides by 9
4 = x
Our Solution
Linear equations can become particularly intersting when the two processes are
combined. In the following problems we have parenthesis and the variable on both
sides. Notice in each of the following examples we distribute, then combine like
terms, then move the variable to one side of the equation.
Example 64.
2(x − 5) + 3x = x + 18
Distribute the 2 through parenthesis
2x − 10 + 3x = x + 18
Combine like terms 2x + 3x
5x − 10 = x + 18
Notice the variable is on both sides
− x
− x
Subtract x from both sides
4x − 10 = 18
Focus on the subtraction of 10
+ 10 + 10
Add 10 to both sides
4x = 28
Focus on multiplication by 4
4
4
Divide both sides by 4
x = 7
Our Solution
Sometimes we may have to distribute more than once to clear several parenthesis.
Remember to combine like terms after you distribute!
Example 65.
3(4x − 5) − 4(2x + 1) = 5
Distribute 3 and − 4 through parenthesis
12x − 15 − 8x − 4 = 5
Combine like terms 12x − 8x and − 15 − 4
4x − 19
= 5
Focus on subtraction of 19
+ 19 + 19
Add 19 to both sides
4x = 24
Focus on multiplication by 4
39
4
4
Divide both sides by 4
x = 6
Our Solution
This leads to a 5-step process to solve any linear equation. While all ﬁve steps
aren’t always needed, this can serve as a guide to solving equations.
1. Distribute through any parentheses.
2. Combine like terms on each side of the equation.
3. Get the variables on one side by adding or subtracting
4. Solve the remaining 2-step equation (add or subtract then multiply or
divide)
5. Check your answer by plugging it back in for x to ﬁnd a true statement.
The order of these steps is very important.
World View Note: The Chinese developed a method for solving equations that
involved ﬁnding each digit one at a time about 2000 years ago!
We can see each of the above ﬁve steps worked through our next example.
Example 66.
4(2x − 6) + 9 = 3(x − 7) + 8x
Distribute 4 and 3 through parenthesis
8x − 24 + 9 = 3x − 21 + 8x
Combine like terms − 24 + 9 and 3x + 8x
8x − 15 = 11x − 21
Notice the variable is on both sides
− 8x
− 8x
Subtract 8x from both sides
− 15 = 3x − 21
Focus on subtraction of 21
+ 21
+ 21
Add 21 to both sides
6 = 3x
Focus on multiplication by 3
3
3
Divide both sides by 3
2 = x
Our Solution
Check:
4[2(2) − 6] + 9 = 3[(2) − 7] + 8(2)
Plug 2 in for each x. Multiply inside parenthesis
4[4 − 6] + 9 = 3[ − 5] + 8(2)
Finish parentesis on left, multiply on right
40
4[ − 2] + 9 = − 15 + 8(2)
Finish multiplication on both sides
− 8 + 9 = − 15 + 16
Add
1 = 1
True!
When we check our solution of x = 2 we found a true statement, 1 = 1. Therefore,
we know our solution x = 2 is the correct solution for the problem.
There are two special cases that can come up as we are solving these linear equa-
tions. The ﬁrst is illustrated in the next two examples. Notice we start by dis-
tributing and moving the variables all to the same side.
Example 67.
3(2x − 5) = 6x − 15
Distribute 3 through parenthesis
6x − 15 = 6x − 15
Notice the variable on both sides
− 6x
− 6x
Subtract 6x from both sides
− 15 = − 15
Variable is gone! True!
Here the variable subtracted out completely! We are left with a true statement,
− 15 = − 15. If the variables subtract out completely and we are left with a true
statement, this indicates that the equation is always true, no matter what x is.
Thus, for our solution we say all real numbers or R.
Example 68.
2(3x − 5) − 4x = 2x + 7
Distribute 2 through parenthesis
6x − 10 − 4x = 2x + 7
Combine like terms 6x − 4x
2x − 10 = 2x + 7
Notice the variable is on both sides
− 2x
− 2x
Subtract 2x from both sides
− 10
� 7
Variable is gone! False!
Again, the variable subtracted out completely! However, this time we are left with
a false statement, this indicates that the equation is never true, no matter what x
is. Thus, for our solution we say no solution or ∅.

Solving Linear Equations - Fractions
Objective: Solve linear equations with rational coeﬃcients by multi-
plying by the least common denominator to clear the fractions.
Often when solving linear equations we will need to work with an equation with
fraction coeﬃcients. We can solve these problems as we have in the past. This is
demonstrated in our next example.
Example 69.

4x − 7

Focus on subtraction
+ 7
2 + 7
2
Add 7
2 to both sides
Notice we will need to get a common denominator to add 5

common denominator of 6. So we build up the denominator, 7

can now add the fractions:

Add 21

Our solution!
While this process does help us arrive at the correct solution, the fractions can
make the process quite diﬃcult. This is why we have an alternate method for
dealing with fractions - clearing fractions. Clearing fractions is nice as it gets rid
of the fractions for the majority of the problem. We can easily clear the fractions
43
by ﬁnding the LCD and multiplying each term by the LCD. This is shown in the
next example, the same problem as our ﬁrst example, but this time we will solve
by clearing fractions.
Example 70.

4x − 7
2 = 5
6
LCD = 12, multiply each term by 12
(12)3
4
x − (12)7
2
= (12)5

Reduce each 12 with denominators
(3)3x − (6)7 = (2)5
Multiply out each term
9x − 42 = 10
Focus on subtraction by 42
+ 42 + 42
Add 42 to both sides
9x = 52
Focus on multiplication by 9
9
9
Divide both sides by 9
x = 52
9
Our Solution
The next example illustrates this as well. Notice the 2 isn’t a fraction in the ori-
gional equation, but to solve it we put the 2 over 1 to make it a fraction.
Example 71.

3x − 2 = 3
2x + 1
6
LCD = 6, multiply each term by 6
(6)2
3
x − (6)2
1
= (6)3
2
x + (6)1
6
Reduce 6 with each denominator
(2)2x − (6)2 = (3)3x + (1)1
Multiply out each term
4x − 12 = 9x + 1
Notice variable on both sides
− 4x
− 4x
Subtract 4x from both sides
− 12 = 5x + 1
Focus on addition of 1

Divide both sides by 5
− 13
5 = x
Our Solution
We can use this same process if there are parenthesis in the problem. We will ﬁrst
distribute the coeﬃcient in front of the parenthesis, then clear the fractions. This
is seen in the following example.
44
Example 72.

x + (18)2

= (18)3

Reduce 18 with each denominator
(3)5x + (2)2 = (18)3
Multiply out each term
15x + 4 = 54
Focus on addition of 4
− 4 − 4
Subtract 4 from both sides
15x = 50
Focus on multiplication by 15
. 15
15
Divide both sides by 15. Reduce on right side.
x = 10
3
Our Solution
While the problem can take many diﬀerent forms, the pattern to clear the frac-
tion is the same, after distributing through any parentheses we multiply each term
by the LCD and reduce. This will give us a problem with no fractions that is
much easier to solve. The following example again illustrates this process.

Notice variable on both sides

Solving Linear Equations - Formulas
Objective: Solve linear formulas for a given variable.
Solving formulas is much like solving general linear equations. The only diﬀerence
is we will have several varaibles in the problem and we will be attempting to solve
for one speciﬁc variable. For example, we may have a formula such as A = πr2 +
πrs (formula for surface area of a right circular cone) and we may be interested in
solving for the varaible s. This means we want to isolate the s so the equation has
s on one side, and everything else on the other. So a solution might look like s =
A − πr2
πs
. This second equation gives the same information as the ﬁrst, they are
algebraically equivalent, however, one is solved for the area, while the other is
solved for s (slant height of the cone). In this section we will discuss how we can
move from the ﬁrst equation to the second.
When solving formulas for a variable we need to focus on the one varaible we are
trying to solve for, all the others are treated just like numbers. This is shown in
the following example. Two parallel problems are shown, the ﬁrst is a normal one-
step equation, the second is a formula that we are solving for x
Example 74.
3x = 12
wx = z
In both problems, x is multiplied by something
3
3
w
w
To isolate the x we divide by 3 or w.
x = 4
x = z
w
Our Solution
We use the same process to solve 3x = 12 for x as we use to solve wx = z for x.
Because we are solving for x we treat all the other variables the same way we
would treat numbers. Thus, to get rid of the multiplication we divided by w. This
same idea is seen in the following example.
Example 75.
m + n = p for n Solving for n, treat all other variables like numbers
− m
− m
Subtract m from both sides
n = p − m
Our Solution
As p and m are not like terms, they cannot be combined. For this reason we leave
the expression as p − m. This same one-step process can be used with grouping
symbols.
47
Example 76.
a(x − y) = b
for a Solving for a, treat (x − y) like a number
(x − y) (x − y)
Divide both sides by (x − y)
a =
b
x − y
Our Solution
Because (x − y) is in parenthesis, if we are not searching for what is inside the
parenthesis, we can keep them together as a group and divide by that group.
However, if we are searching for what is inside the parenthesis, we will have to
break up the parenthesis by distributing. The following example is the same for-
mula, but this time we will solve for x.
Example 77.
a(x − y) = b for x Solving for x, we need to distribute to clear parenthesis
ax − ay = b
This is a two − step equation, ay is subtracted from our x term
+ ay + ay
Add ay to both sides
ax = b + ay
The x is multipied by a
a
a
Divide both sides by a
x = b + ay
a
Our Solution
Be very careful as we isolate x that we do not try and cancel the a on top and
bottom of the fraction. This is not allowed if there is any adding or subtracting in
the fraction. There is no reducing possible in this problem, so our ﬁnal reduced
answer remains x = b + ay
a
. The next example is another two-step problem
Example 78.
y = mx + b for m Solving for m, focus on addition ﬁrst
− b
− b
Subtract b from both sides
y − b = mx
m is multipied by x.
x
x
Divide both sides by x
y − b
x
= m
Our Solution
It is important to note that we know we are done with the problem when the
variable we are solving for is isolated or alone on one side of the equation and it
does not appear anywhere on the other side of the equation.
The next example is also a two-step equation, it is the problem we started with at
the beginning of the lesson.
48
Example 79.
A = πr2 + πrs for s Solving for s, focus on what is added to the term with s
− πr2 − πr2
Subtract πr2 from both sides
A − πr2 = πrs
s is multipied by πr
πr
πr
Divide both sides by πr
A − πr2
πr
= s
Our Solution
Again, we cannot reduce the πr in the numerator and denominator because of the
subtraction in the problem.
Formulas often have fractions in them and can be solved in much the same way
we solved with fractions before. First identify the LCD and then multiply each
term by the LCD. After we reduce there will be no more fractions in the problem
so we can solve like any general equation from there.
Example 80.
h = 2m
n
for m To clear the fraction we use LCD = n
(n)h = (n)2m
n
Multiply each term by n
nh = 2m
Reduce n with denominators
2
2
Divide both sides by 2
nh
2 = m
Our Solution
The same pattern can be seen when we have several fractions in our problem.
Example 81.
a
b + c
b = e for a To clear the fraction we use LCD = b
(b)a
b
+ (b)c
b
= e (b)
Multiply each term by b
a + c = eb
Reduce b with denominators
− c − c
Subtract c from both sides
a = eb − c
Our Solution
Depending on the context of the problem we may ﬁnd a formula that uses the
same letter, one capital, one lowercase. These represent diﬀerent values and we
must be careful not to combine a capital variable with a lower case variable.
Example 82.
a =
A
2 − b for b Use LCD (2 − b) as a group
49
(2 − b)a = (2 − b)A
2 − b
Multiply each term by (2 − b)
(2 − b)a = A
reduce (2 − b) with denominator
2a − ab = A
Distribute through parenthesis
− 2a
− 2a
Subtract 2a from both sides
− ab = A − 2a
The b is multipied by − a
− a
− a
Divide both sides by − a
b = A − 2a
− a
Our Solution
Notice the A and a were not combined as like terms. This is because a formula
will often use a capital letter and lower case letter to represent diﬀerent variables.
Often with formulas there is more than one way to solve for a variable. The next
example solves the same problem in a slightly diﬀerent manner. After clearing the
denominator, we divide by a to move it to the other side, rather than distributing.
Example 83.
a =
A
2 − b for b Use LCD = (2 − b) as a group
(2 − b)a = (2 − b)A
2 − b
Multiply each term by (2 − b)
(2 − b)a = A
Reduce (2 − b) with denominator
a
a
Divide both sides by a
2 − b = A
a
Focus on the positive 2
− 2
− 2
Subtract 2 from both sides
− b = A
a − 2
Still need to clear the negative
( − 1)( − b) = ( − 1)A
a − 2( − 1)
Multiply (or divide) each term by − 1
b = − A
a + 2
Our Solution
Both answers to the last two examples are correct, they are just written in a dif-
ferent form because we solved them in diﬀerent ways. This is very common with
formulas, there may be more than one way to solve for a varaible, yet both are
equivalent and correct.
World View Note: The father of algebra, Persian mathematician Muhammad
ibn Musa Khwarizmi, introduced the fundamental idea of blancing by subtracting
the same term to the other side of the equation. He called this process al-jabr
which later became the world algebra.

Solving Linear Equations - Absolute Value
Objective: Solve linear absolute value equations.
When solving equations with absolute value we can end up with more than one
possible answer. This is because what is in the absolute value can be either nega-
tive or positive and we must account for both possibilities when solving equations.
This is illustrated in the following example.
Example 84.
|x| = 7
Absolute value can be positive or negative
x = 7 or x = − 7
Our Solution
Notice that we have considered two possibilities, both the positive and negative.
Either way, the absolute value of our number will be positive 7.
World View Note: The ﬁrst set of rules for working with negatives came from
7th century India. However, in 1758, almost a thousand years later, British math-
ematician Francis Maseres claimed that negatives “Darken the very whole doc-
trines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature
excessively obvious and simple.”
When we have absolute values in our problem it is important to ﬁrst isolate the
absolute value, then remove the absolute value by considering both the positive
and negative solutions. Notice in the next two examples, all the numbers outside
of the absolute value are moved to the other side ﬁrst before we remove the abso-
lute value bars and consider both positive and negative solutions.
Example 85.
5 + |x| = 8
Notice absolute value is not alone
− 5
− 5
Subtract 5 from both sides
|x| = 3
Absolute value can be positive or negative
x = 3 or x = − 3
Our Solution
Example 86.
− 4|x| = − 20
Notice absolute value is not alone
− 4
− 4
Divide both sides by − 4
52
|x| = 5
Absolute value can be positive or negative
x = 5 or x = − 5
Our Solution
Notice we never combine what is inside the absolute value with what is outside
the absolute value. This is very important as it will often change the ﬁnal result
to an incorrect solution. The next example requires two steps to isolate the abso-
lute value. The idea is the same as a two-step equation, add or subtract, then
multiply or divide.
Example 87.
5|x| − 4 = 26
Notice the absolute value is not alone
+ 4 + 4
Add 4 to both sides
5|x| = 30
Absolute value still not alone
5
5
Divide both sides by 5
|x| = 6
Absolute value can be positive or negative
x = 6 or x = − 6
Our Solution
Again we see the same process, get the absolute value alone ﬁrst, then consider
the positive and negative solutions. Often the absolute value will have more than
just a variable in it. In this case we will have to solve the resulting equations
when we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is shown in the next
example.
Example 88.
|2x − 1| = 7
Absolute value can be positive or negative
2x − 1 = 7 or 2x − 1 = − 7
Two equations to solve
Now notice we have two equations to solve, each equation will give us a diﬀerent
solution. Both equations solve like any other two-step equation.
2x − 1 = 7
+ 1 + 1
2x = 8
2
2
x = 4
or
2x − 1 = − 7
+ 1 + 1
2x = − 6
2
2
x = − 3
53
Thus, from our previous example we have two solutions, x = 4 or x = − 3.
Again, it is important to remember that the absolute value must be alone ﬁrst
before we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is illustrated in
below.
Example 89.
2 − 4|2x + 3| = − 18
To get the absolute value alone we ﬁrst need to get rid of the 2 by subtracting,
then divide by − 4. Notice we cannot combine the 2 and − 4 becuase they are
not like terms, the − 4 has the absolute value connected to it. Also notice we do
not distribute the − 4 into the absolute value. This is because the numbers out-
side cannot be combined with the numbers inside the absolute value. Thus we get
the absolute value alone in the following way:
2 − 4|2x + 3| = − 18
Notice absolute value is not alone
− 2
− 2
Subtract 2 from both sides
− 4|2x + 3| = − 20
Absolute value still not alone
− 4
− 4
Divide both sides by − 4
|2x + 3| = 5
Absoloute value can be positive or negative
2x + 3 = 5 or 2x + 3 = − 5
Two equations to solve
Now we just solve these two remaining equations to ﬁnd our solutions.
2x + 3 = 5
− 3 − 3
2x = 2
2
2
x = 1
or
2x + 3 = − 5
− 3 − 3
2x = − 8
2
2
x = − 4
We now have our two solutions, x = 1 and x = − 4.
As we are solving absolute value equations it is important to be aware of special
cases. Remember the result of an absolute value must always be positive. Notice
what happens in the next example.
54
Example 90.
7 + |2x − 5| = 4
Notice absolute value is not alone
− 7
− 7
Subtract 7 from both sides
|2x − 5| = − 3
Result of absolute value is negative!
Notice the absolute value equals a negative number! This is impossible with abso-
lute value. When this occurs we say there is no solution or ∅.
One other type of absolute value problem is when two absolute values are equal to
eachother. We still will consider both the positive and negative result, the diﬀer-
ence here will be that we will have to distribute a negative into the second abso-
lute value for the negative possibility.
Example 91.
|2x − 7| = |4x + 6|
Absolute value can be positive or negative
2x − 7 = 4x + 6 or 2x − 7 = − (4x + 6)
makesecondpartofsecondequationnegative
Notice the ﬁrst equation is the positive possibility and has no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence other than the missing absolute value bars. The second equation considers
the negative possibility. For this reason we have a negative in front of the expres-
sion which will be distributed through the equation on the ﬁrst step of solving. So
we solve both these equations as follows:
2x − 7 = 4x + 6
− 2x − 2x
− 7 = 2x + 6
− 6
− 6
− 13 = 2x
2
2
− 13
2
= x
or
2x − 7 = − (4x + 6)
2x − 7 = − 4x − 6
+ 4x
+ 4x
6x − 7 = − 6
+ 7
+ 7
6x = 1
6
6
x = 1
6
This gives us our two solutions, x = − 13
2
or x = 1

Solving Linear Equations - Variation
Objective: Solve variation problems by creating variation equations and
ﬁnding the variation constant.
One application of solving linear equations is variation. Often diﬀerent events are
related by what is called the constant of variation. For example, the time it takes
to travel a certain distance is related to how fast you are traveling. The faster you
travel, the less time it take to get there. This is one type of variation problem, we
will look at three types of variation here. Variation problems have two or three
variables and a constant in them. The constant, usually noted with a k, describes
the relationship and does not change as the other variables in the problem change.
There are two ways to set up a variation problem, the ﬁrst solves for one of the
variables, a second method is to solve for the constant. Here we will use the
second method.
The greek letter pi (π) is used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter.
World View Note: In the 5th centure, Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi cal-
culated the value of π to seven decimal places (3.1415926). This was the most
accurate value of π for the next 1000 years!
If you take any circle and divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter
you will always get the same value, about 3.14159... If you have a bigger circum-
ference you will also have a bigger diameter. This relationship is called direct
variation or directly proportional. If we see this phrase in the problem we
know to divide to ﬁnd the constant of variation.
Example 92.
m is varies directly as n
′′Directly′′ tells us to divide
m
n = k
Our formula for the relationship
In kickboxing, one will ﬁnd that the longer the board, the easier it is to break. If
you multiply the force required to break a board by the length of the board you
will also get a constant. Here, we are multiplying the variables, which means as
one variable increases, the other variable decreases. This relationship is called
indirect variation or inversly proportional. If we see this phrase in the
problem we know to multiply to ﬁnd the constant of variation.
Example 93.
y is inversely proportional to z
′′Inversely′′ tells us to multiply
yz = k
Our formula for the relationship
57
The formula for the area of a triangle has three variables in it. If we divide the
area by the base times the height we will also get a constant, 1
2. This relationship
is called joint variation or jointly proportional. If we see this phrase in the
problem we know to divide the ﬁrst variable by the product of the other two to
ﬁnd the constant of variation.
Example 94.
A varies jointly as x and y
′′Jointly′′ tells us to divide by the product
A
xy = k
Our formula for the relationship
Once we have our formula for the relationship in a variation problem, we use
given or known information to calculate the constant of variation. This is shown
for each type of variation in the next three examples.
Example 95.
w is directly proportional to y and w = 50 when y = 5
w
y = k
′′directly′′ tells us to divide
(50)
(5) = k
Substitute known values
10 = k
Evaluate to ﬁnd our constant
Example 96.
c varies indirectly as d and c = 4.5 when d = 6
cd = k
′′indirectly′′ tells us to multiply
(4.5)(6) = k
Substitute known values
27 = k
Evaluate to ﬁnd our constant
Example 97.
x is jointly proportional to y and z and x = 48 when y = 2 and z = 4
x
yz = k
′′Jointly′′ tells us to divide by the product
(48)
(2)(4) = k
Substitute known values
6 = k
Evaluate to ﬁnd our constant
58
Once we have found the constant of variation we can use it to ﬁnd other combina-
tions in the same relationship. Each of these problems we solve will have three
important steps, none of which should be skipped.
1. Find the formula for the relationship using the type of variation
2. Find the constant of variation using known values
3. Answer the question using the constant of variation
The next three examples show how this process is worked out for each type of
variation.
Example 98.
The price of an item varies directly with the sales tax. If a S25 item has a sales tax of S2,
what will the tax be on a S40 item?
p
t = k
′′Directly′′ tells us to divide price (p) and tax (t)
(25)
(2) = k
Substitute known values for price and tax
12.5 = k
Evaluate to ﬁnd our constant
40
t = 12.5
Using our constant, substitute 40 for price to ﬁnd the tax
(t)40
t
= 12.5(t)
Multiply by LCD = t to clear fraction
40 = 12.5t
Reduce the t with the denominator
12.5 12.5
Divide by 12.5
3.2 = t
Our solution: Tax is S3.20
Example 99.
The speed (or rate) Josiah travels to work is inversely proportional to time it
takes to get there. If he travels 35 miles per hour it will take him 2.5 hours to get
to work. How long will it take him if he travels 55 miles per hour?
rt = k
′′Inversely′′ tells us to multiply the rate and time
(35)(2.5) = k
Substitute known values for rate and time
87.5 = k
Evaluate to ﬁnd our constant
55t = 87.5
Using our constant, substitute 55 for rate to ﬁnd the time
55
55
Divide both sides by 55
t ≈ 1.59
Our solution: It takes him 1.59 hours to get to work
Example 100.
59
The amount of simple interest earned on an investment varies jointly as the prin-
ciple (amount invested) and the time it is invested. In an account, S150 invested
for 2 years earned S12 in interest. How much interest would be earned on a S220
investment for 3 years?
I
Pt = k
′′Jointly′′ divideInterest(I)byproductofPrinciple(P)&time(t)
(12)
(150)(2) = k
Substitute known values for Interest, Principle and time
0.04 = k
Evaluate to ﬁnd our constant
I
(220)(3) = 0.04
Using constant, substitute 220 for principle and 3 for time
I
660 = 0.04
Evaluate denominator
(660)I
660
= 0.04(660)
Multiply by 660 to isolate the variable
I = 26.4
Our Solution: The investment earned S26.40 in interest
Sometimes a variation problem will ask us to do something to a variable as we set
up the formula for the relationship. For example, π can be thought of as the ratio
of the area and the radius squared. This is still direct variation, we say the area
varies directly as the radius square and thus our variable is squared in our for-
mula. This is shown in the next example.
Example 101.
The area of a circle is directly proportional to the square of the radius. A circle
with a radius of 10 has an area of 314. What will the area be on a circle of radius
4?
A
r2 = k
′′Direct′′ tells us to divide, be sure we use r2 for the denominator
(314)
(10)2 = k
Substitute known values into our formula
(314)
100 = k
Exponents ﬁrst
3.14 = k
Divide to ﬁnd our constant
A
(4)2 = 3.14
Using the constant, use 4 for r, don′t forget the squared!
A
16 = 3.14
Evaluate the exponent
(16)A
16
= 3.14(16)
Multiply both sides by 16
A = 50.24
Our Solution: Area is 50.24
When solving variation problems it is important to take the time to clearly state
the variation formula, ﬁnd the constant, and solve the ﬁnal equation.

Linear Equations - Number and Geometry
Objective: Solve number and
geometry problems by creating and
solving a linear equation.
Word problems can be tricky. Often it takes a bit of practice to convert the
English sentence into a mathematical sentence. This is what we will focus on here
with some basic number problems, geometry problems, and parts problems.
A few important phrases are described below that can give us clues for how to set
up a problem.
•
A number (or unknown, a value, etc) often becomes our variable
•
Is (or other forms of is: was, will be, are, etc) often represents equals (=)
x is 5 becomes x = 5
•
More than often represents addition and is usually built backwards,
writing the second part plus the ﬁrst
Three more than a number becomes x + 3
•
Less than often represents subtraction and is usually built backwards as
well, writing the second part minus the ﬁrst
Four less than a number becomes x − 4
Using these key phrases we can take a number problem and set up and equation
and solve.
Example 102.
If 28 less than ﬁve times a certain number is 232. What is the number?
5x − 28
Subtraction is built backwards, multiply the unknown by 5
5x − 28 = 232
Is translates to equals
+ 28 + 28
Add 28 to both sides
5x = 260
The variable is multiplied by 5
5
5
Divide both sides by 5
x = 52
The number is 52.
This same idea can be extended to a more involved problem as shown in the next
example.
Example 103.
64
Fifteen more than three times a number is the same as ten less than six times the
number. What is the number
3x + 15
First, addition is built backwards
6x − 10
Then, subtraction is also built backwards
3x + 15 = 6x − 10
Is between the parts tells us they must be equal
− 3x
− 3x
Subtract 3x so variable is all on one side
15 = 3x − 10
Now we have a two − step equation
+ 10
+ 10
Add 10 to both sides
25 = 3x
The variable is multiplied by 3
3
3
Divide both sides by 3
25
3 = x
Our number is 25
3
Another type of number problem involves consecutive numbers. Consecutive
numbers are numbers that come one after the other, such as 3, 4, 5. If we are
looking for several consecutive numbers it is important to ﬁrst identify what they
look like with variables before we set up the equation. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example.
Example 104.
The sum of three consecutive integers is 93. What are the integers?
First x
Make the ﬁrst number x
Second x + 1
To get the next number we go up one or + 1
Third x + 2
Add another 1(2 total) to get the third
F + S + T = 93
First (F) plus Second (S) plus Third (T) equals 93
(x) + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 93
Replace F with x, S with x + 1, and T with x + 2
x + x + 1 + x + 2 = 93
Here the parenthesis aren′t needed.
3x + 3 = 93
Combine like terms x + x + x and 2 + 1
− 3 − 3
Add 3 to both sides
3x = 90
The variable is multiplied by 3
3
3
Divide both sides by 3
x = 30
Our solution for x
First 30
Replace x in our origional list with 30
Second (30) + 1 = 31
The numbers are 30, 31, and 32
Third (30) + 2 = 32
Sometimes we will work consective even or odd integers, rather than just consecu-
tive integers. When we had consecutive integers, we only had to add 1 to get to
the next number so we had x, x + 1, and x + 2 for our ﬁrst, second, and third
number respectively. With even or odd numbers they are spaced apart by two. So
if we want three consecutive even numbers, if the ﬁrst is x, the next number
would be x + 2, then ﬁnally add two more to get the third, x + 4. The same is
65
true for consecutive odd numbers, if the ﬁrst is x, the next will be x + 2, and the
third would be x + 4. It is important to note that we are still adding 2 and 4 even
when the numbers are odd. This is because the phrase “odd” is refering to our x,
not to what is added to the numbers. Consider the next two examples.
Example 105.
The sum of three consecutive even integers is 246. What are the numbers?
First x
Make the ﬁrst x
Second x + 2
Even numbers, so we add 2 to get the next
Third x + 4
Add 2 more (4 total) to get the third
F + S + T = 246
SummeansaddFirst(F)plusSecond(S)plusThird(T)
(x) + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 246
Replace each F , S, and T with what we labeled them
x + x + 2 + x + 4 = 246
Here the parenthesis are not needed
3x + 6 = 246
Combine like terms x + x + x and 2 + 4
− 6 − 6
Subtract 6 from both sides
3x = 240
The variable is multiplied by 3
3
3
Divide both sides by 3
x = 80
Our solution for x
First 80
Replace x in the origional list with 80.
Second (80) + 2 = 82
The numbers are 80, 82, and 84.
Third ( 80) + 4 = 84
Example 106.
Find three consecutive odd integers so that the sum of twice the ﬁrst, the second
and three times the third is 152.
First x
Make the ﬁrst x
Second x + 2
Odd numbers so we add 2(same as even!)
Third x + 4
Add 2 more (4 total) to get the third
2F + S + 3T = 152
Twicetheﬁrstgives2F andthreetimesthethirdgives3T
2(x) + (x + 2) + 3(x + 4) = 152
Replace F , S, and T with what we labled them
2x + x + 2 + 3x + 12 = 152
Distribute through parenthesis
6x + 14 = 152
Combine like terms 2x + x + 3x and 2 + 14
− 14 − 14
Subtract 14 from both sides
6x = 138
Variable is multiplied by 6
6
6
Divide both sides by 6
x = 23
Our solution for x
First 23
Replace x with 23 in the original list
Second (23) + 2 = 25
The numbers are 23, 25, and 27
Third (23) + 4 = 27
66
When we started with our ﬁrst, second, and third numbers for both even and odd
we had x, x + 2, and x + 4. The numbers added do not change with odd or even,
it is our answer for x that will be odd or even.
Another example of translating English sentences to mathematical sentences
comes from geometry. A well known property of triangles is that all three angles
will always add to 180. For example, the ﬁrst angle may be 50 degrees, the second
30 degrees, and the third 100 degrees. If you add these together, 50 + 30 + 100 =
180. We can use this property to ﬁnd angles of triangles.
World View Note: German mathematician Bernhart Thibaut in 1809 tried to
prove that the angles of a triangle add to 180 without using Euclid’s parallel pos-
tulate (a point of much debate in math history). He created a proof, but it was
later shown to have an error in the proof.
Example 107.
The second angle of a triangle is double the ﬁrst. The third angle is 40 less than
the ﬁrst. Find the three angles.
First x
With nothing given about the ﬁrst we make that x
Second 2x
The second is double the ﬁrst,
Third x − 40
The third is 40 less than the ﬁrst
F + S + T = 180
All three angles add to 180
(x) + (2x) + (x − 40) = 180
Replace F , S, and T with the labeled values.
x + 2x + x − 40 = 180
Here the parenthesis are not needed.
4x − 40 = 180
Combine like terms, x + 2x + x
+ 40 + 40
Add 40 to both sides
4x = 220
The variable is multiplied by 4
4
4
Divide both sides by 4
x = 55
Our solution for x
First 55
Replace x with 55 in the original list of angles
Second 2(55) = 110
Our angles are 55, 110, and 15
Third (55) − 40 = 15
Another geometry problem involves perimeter or the distance around an object.
For example, consider a rectangle has a length of 8 and a width of 3. There are
two lengths and two widths in a rectangle (opposite sides) so we add 8 + 8 + 3 +
3 = 22. As there are two lengths and two widths in a rectangle an alternative to
ﬁnd the perimeter of a rectangle is to use the formula P = 2L + 2W. So for the
rectangle of length 8 and width 3 the formula would give, P = 2(8) + 2(3) = 16 +
6 = 22. With problems that we will consider here the formula P = 2L + 2W will be
used.
Example 108.
67
The perimeter of a rectangle is 44. The length is 5 less than double the width.
Find the dimensions.
Length x
We will make the length x
Width 2x − 5
Width is ﬁve less than two times the length
P = 2L + 2W
The formula for perimeter of a rectangle
(44) = 2(x) + 2(2x − 5)
Replace P , L, and W with labeled values
44 = 2x + 4x − 10
Distribute through parenthesis
44 = 6x − 10
Combine like terms 2x + 4x
+ 10
+ 10
Add 10 to both sides
54 = 6x
The variable is multiplied by 6
6
6
Divide both sides by 6
9 = x
Our solution for x
Length 9
Replace x with 9 in the origional list of sides
Width 2(9) − 5 = 13
The dimensions of the rectangle are 9 by 13.
We have seen that it is imortant to start by clearly labeling the variables in a
short list before we begin to solve the problem. This is important in all word
problems involving variables, not just consective numbers or geometry problems.
This is shown in the following example.
Example 109.
A sofa and a love seat together costs S444. The sofa costs double the love seat.
How much do they each cost?
Love Seat x
With no information about the love seat, this is our x
Sofa 2x
Sofa is double the love seat, so we multiply by 2
S + L = 444
Together they cost 444, so we add.
(x) + (2x) = 444
Replace S and L with labeled values
3x = 444
Parenthesis are not needed, combine like terms x + 2x
3
3
Divide both sides by 3
x = 148
Our solution for x
Love Seat 148
Replace x with 148 in the origional list
Sofa 2(148) = 296
The love seat costs S148 and the sofa costs S296.
Be careful on problems such as these. Many students see the phrase “double” and
believe that means we only have to divide the 444 by 2 and get S222 for one or
both of the prices. As you can see this will not work. By clearly labeling the vari-
ables in the original list we know exactly how to set up and solve these problems.

Solving Linear Equations - Age Problems
Objective: Solve age problems by creating and solving a linear equa-
tion.
An application of linear equations is what are called age problems. When we are
solving age problems we generally will be comparing the age of two people both
now and in the future (or past). Using the clues given in the problem we will be
working to ﬁnd their current age. There can be a lot of information in these prob-
lems and we can easily get lost in all the information. To help us organize and
solve our problem we will ﬁll out a three by three table for each problem. An
example of the basic structure of the table is below
Age Now Change
Person 1
Person 2
Table 6. Structure of Age Table
Normally where we see “Person 1” and “Person 2” we will use the name of the
person we are talking about. We will use this table to set up the following
example.
Example 110.
Adam is 20 years younger than Brian. In two years Brian will be twice as old as
Adam. How old are they now?
Age Now + 2
Adam
Brian
We use Adam and Brian for our persons
We use + 2 for change because the second phrase
is two years in the future
Age Now + 2
Adam
x − 20
Brain
x
Consider the ′′Now′′ part, Adam is 20 years
youger than Brian. We are given information about
Adam, not Brian. So Brian is x now. To show Adam
is 20 years younger we subtract 20, Adam is x − 20.
Age Now
+ 2
Adam
x − 20
x − 20 + 2
Brian
x
x + 2
Now the + 2 column is ﬁlled in. This is done by adding
2 to both Adam′s and Brian′s now column as shown
in the table.
Age Now
+ 2
Adam
x − 20
x − 18
Brian
x
x + 2
Combine like terms in Adam′s future age: − 20 + 2
This table is now ﬁlled out and we are ready to try
and solve.
72
B = 2A
Our equation comes from the future statement:
Brian will be twice as old as Adam. This means
the younger, Adam, needs to be multiplied by 2.
(x + 2) = 2(x − 18)
Replace B and A with the information in their future
cells, Adam (A) is replaced with x − 18 and Brian (B)
is replaced with (x + 2) This is the equation to solve!
x + 2 = 2x − 36
Distribute through parenthesis
− x
− x
Subtract x from both sides to get variable on one side
2 = x − 36
Need to clear the − 36
+ 36
+ 36
Add 36 to both sides
38 = x
Our solution for x
Age now
Adam 38 − 20 = 18
Brian
38
The ﬁrst column will help us answer the question.
Replace the x′s with 38 and simplify.
Adam is 18 and Brian is 38
Solving age problems can be summarized in the following ﬁve steps. These ﬁve
steps are guidelines to help organize the problem we are trying to solve.
1. Fill in the now column. The person we know nothing about is x.
2. Fill in the future/past collumn by adding/subtracting the change to the
now column.
3. Make an equation for the relationship in the future. This is independent of
the table.
4. Replace variables in equation with information in future cells of table
5. Solve the equation for x, use the solution to answer the question
These ﬁve steps can be seen illustrated in the following example.
Example 111.
Carmen is 12 years older than David. Five years ago the sum of their ages was 28.
How old are they now?
Age Now − 5
Carmen
David
Five years ago is − 5 in the change column.
Age Now − 5
Carmen
x + 12
David
x
Carmen is 12 years older than David. We don′t
know about David so he is x, Carmen then is x + 12
Age Now
− 5
Carmen
x + 12
x + 12 − 5
David
x
x − 5
Subtract 5 from now column to get the change
73
Age Now

Carmen
x + 12
x + 7
David
x
x − 5
Simplify by combining like terms 12 − 5
Our table is ready!
C + D = 28
Thesumoftheirageswillbe29.SoweaddC andD
(x + 7) + (x − 5) = 28
Replace C and D with the change cells.
x + 7 + x − 5 = 28
Remove parenthesis
2x + 2 = 28
Combine like terms x + x and 7 − 5
− 2 − 2
Subtract 2 from both sides
2x = 26
Notice x is multiplied by 2
2
2
Divide both sides by 2
x = 13
Our solution for x
Age Now
Caremen 13 + 12 = 25
David
13
Replace x with 13 to answer the question
Carmen is 25 and David is 13
Sometimes we are given the sum of their ages right now. These problems can be
tricky. In this case we will write the sum above the now column and make the
ﬁrst person’s age now x. The second person will then turn into the subtraction
problem total − x. This is shown in the next example.
Example 112.
The sum of the ages of Nicole and Kristin is 32. In two years Nicole will be three
times as old as Kristin. How old are they now?
32
Age Now + 2
Nicole
x
Kristen
32 − x
The change is + 2 for two years in the future
The total is placed above Age Now
The ﬁrst person is x. The second becomes 32 − x
Age Now
+ 2
Nicole
x
x + 2
Kristen
32 − x
32 − x + 2
Add 2 to each cell ﬁll in the change column
Age Now
+ 2
Nicole
x
x + 2
Kristen
32 − x
34 − x
Combine like terms 32 + 2, our table is done!
N = 3K
Nicole is three times as old as Kristin.
(x + 2) = 3(34 − x)
Replace variables with information in change cells
x + 2 = 102 − 3x
Distribute through parenthesis
+ 3x
+ 3x
Add 3x to both sides so variable is only on one side
74
4x + 2 = 102
Solve the two − step equation
− 2
− 2
Subtract 2 from both sides
4x = 100
The variable is multiplied by 4
4
4
Divide both sides by 4
x = 25
Our solution for x
Age Now
Nicole
25
Kristen 32 − 25 = 7
Plug 25 in for x in the now column
Nicole is 25 and Kristin is 7
A slight variation on age problems is to ask not how old the people are, but
rather ask how long until we have some relationship about their ages. In this case
we alter our table slightly. In the change column because we don’t know the time
to add or subtract we will use a variable, t, and add or subtract this from the now
column. This is shown in the next example.
Example 113.
Louis is 26 years old. Her daughter is 4 years old. In how many years will Louis
be double her daughter’s age?
Age Now + t
Louis
26
Daughter
4
As we are given their ages now, these numbers go into
the table. The change is unknown, so we write + t for
the change
Age Now
+ t
Louis
26
26 + t
Daughter
4
4 + t
Fill in the change column by adding t to each person′s
age. Our table is now complete.
L = 2D
Louis will be double her daughter
(26 + t) = 2(4 + t)
Replace variables with information in change cells
26 + t = 8 + 2t
Distribute through parenthesis
− t
− t
Subtract t from both sides
26 = 8 + t
Now we have an 8 added to the t
− 8 − 8
Subtract 8 from both sides
18 = t
In 18 years she will be double her daughter′s age
Age problems have several steps to them. However, if we take the time to work
through each of the steps carefully, keeping the information organized, the prob-
lems can be solved quite nicely.

Japan who lived to be 120 years, 237 days. However, his exact age has been dis-
puted.

Solving Linear Equations - Distance, Rate and Time
Objective: Solve distance problems by creating and solving a linear
equation.
An application of linear equations can be found in distance problems. When
solving distance problems we will use the relationship rt = d or rate (speed) times
time equals distance. For example, if a person were to travel 30 mph for 4 hours.
To ﬁnd the total distance we would multiply rate times time or (30)(4) = 120.
This person travel a distance of 120 miles. The problems we will be solving here
will be a few more steps than described above. So to keep the information in the
problem organized we will use a table. An example of the basic structure of the
table is blow:
Rate Time Distance
Person 1
Person 2
Table 7. Structure of Distance Problem
The third column, distance, will always be ﬁlled in by multiplying the rate and
time columns together. If we are given a total distance of both persons or trips we
will put this information below the distance column. We will now use this table to
set up and solve the following example
79
Example 114.
Two joggers start from opposite ends of an 8 mile course running towards each
other. One jogger is running at a rate of 4 mph, and the other is running at a
rate of 6 mph. After how long will the joggers meet?

We are given the rates for each jogger.
These are added to the table

The distance column is ﬁlled in by multiplying
rate by time
8
We have total distance, 8 miles, under distance
4t + 6t = 8
The distance column gives equation by adding
10t = 8
Combine like terms, 4t + 6t
10 10
Divide both sides by 10
t = 4
5
Our solution for t, 4
5 hour (48 minutes)
As the example illustrates, once the table is ﬁlled in, the equation to solve is very
easy to ﬁnd. This same process can be seen in the following example
Example 115.
Bob and Fred start from the same point and walk in opposite directions. Bob
walks 2 miles per hour faster than Fred. After 3 hours they are 30 miles apart.
How fast did each walk?

Distance column is ﬁlled in by multiplying rate by

Total distance is put under distance
3r + 6 + 3r = 30
The distance columns is our equation, by adding
6r + 6 = 30
Combine like terms 3r + 3r
− 6 − 6
Subtract 6 from both sides
6r = 24
The variable is multiplied by 6
6

Divide both sides by 6
r = 4
Our solution for r

To answer the question completely we plug 4 in for
r in the table. Bob traveled 6 miles per hour and
Fred traveled 4 mph
Some problems will require us to do a bit of work before we can just ﬁll in the
cells. One example of this is if we are given a total time, rather than the indi-
vidual times like we had in the previous example. If we are given total time we
will write this above the time column, use t for the ﬁrst person’s time, and make
a subtraction problem, Total − t, for the second person’s time. This is shown in
the next example
Example 116.
Two campers left their campsite by canoe and paddled downstream at an average
speed of 12 mph. They turned around and paddled back upstream at an average
rate of 4 mph. The total trip took 1 hour. After how much time did the campers
turn around downstream?

With equal sign, distance colum is equation

Our solution, turn around after 1
4 hr (15 min )
Another type of a distance problem where we do some work is when one person
catches up with another. Here a slower person has a head start and the faster
person is trying to catch up with him or her and we want to know how long it
will take the fast person to do this. Our startegy for this problem will be to use t
for the faster person’s time, and add amount of time the head start was to get the
slower person’s time. This is shown in the next example.
Example 117.
Mike leaves his house traveling 2 miles per hour. Joy leaves 6 hours later to catch
up with him traveling 8 miles per hour. How long will it take her to catch up
with him?

Distance column is found by multiplying the rate

As they cover the same distance, = is put after
Mike′s distance
2t + 12 = 8t
Now the distance column is the equation
− 2t
− 2t
Subtract 2t from both sides
12 = 6t
The variable is multiplied by 6

Divide both sides by 6

2 = t
Our solution for t, she catches him after 2 hours
World View Note: The 10,000 race is the longest standard track event. 10,000
meters is approximately 6.2 miles. The current (at the time of printing) world
record for this race is held by Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele with a time of 26 min-
utes, 17.53 second. That is a rate of 12.7 miles per hour!
As these example have shown, using the table can help keep all the given informa-
tion organized, help ﬁll in the cells, and help ﬁnd the equation we will solve. The
ﬁnal example clearly illustrates this.
Example 118.
On a 130 mile trip a car travled at an average speed of 55 mph and then reduced
its speed to 40 mph for the remainder of the trip. The trip took 2.5 hours. For
how long did the car travel 40 mph?

Graphing - Points and Lines
Objective: Graph points and lines using xy coordinates.
Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation we will make a picture that
represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solu-
tions to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a visual representa-
tion of an equation, we ﬁrst have to understand the basis of graphing. Following
is an example of what is called the coordinate plane.

The plane is divided into four sections
by a horizontal number line (x-axis)
and a vertical number line (y-axis).
Where the two lines meet in the center
is called the origin. This center origin
is where x = 0 and y = 0. As we move
to the right the numbers count up
from zero, representing x = 1, 2, 3 � .
To the left the numbers count down from zero, representing x = − 1, − 2, − 3 � .
Similarly, as we move up the number count up from zero, y = 1, 2, 3 � ., and as we
move down count down from zero, y = − 1, − 2, − 3. We can put dots on the
graph which we will call points. Each point has an “address” that deﬁnes its loca-
tion. The ﬁrst number will be the value on the x − axis or horizontal number line.
This is the distance the point moves left/right from the origin. The second
number will represent the value on the y − axis or vertical number line. This is
the distance the point moves up/down from the origin. The points are given as an
ordered pair (x, y).
World View Note: Locations on the globe are given in the same manner, each
number is a distance from a central point, the origin which is where the prime
meridian and the equator. This “origin is just oﬀ the western coast of Africa.
The following example ﬁnds the address or coordinate pair for each of several
points on the coordinate plane.
Example 119.
Give the coordinates of each point.
A
B
C
89
Tracing from the origin, point A is
right 1, up 4. This becomes A(1, 4).
Point B is left 5, up 3. Left is back-
wards or negative so we have B( − 5,
3). C is straight down 2 units. There
is no left or right. This means we go
right zero so the point is C(0, − 2).
A(1, 4), B( − 5, 3), C(0, − 2)
Our Solution
Just as we can give the coordinates for a set of points, we can take a set of points
and plot them on the plane.
Example 120.
Graph the points A(3, 2), B( − 2, 1), C (3, − 4), D( − 2, − 3), E( − 3, 0), F (0, 2),
G(0, 0)
Right 3
Up 2
A
Left 2
Up 1
B
The ﬁrst point, A is at (3, 2) this
means x = 3 (right 3) and y = 2 (up 2).
Following these instructions, starting
from the origin, we get our point.
The second point, B( − 2, 1), is left 2
(negative
moves
backwards),
up
1.
This is also illustrated on the graph.
A
B

C
Right 3
Left 2
Down 3
Down 4
The third point, C (3, − 4) is right 3,
down 4 (negative moves backwards).
The fourth point, D ( − 2, − 3) is left
2, down 3 (both negative, both move
backwards)
The last three points have zeros in them. We still treat these points just like the
other points. If there is a zero there is just no movement.
Up 2
Left 3

Next is E( − 3, 0). This is left 3 (nega-
tive is backwards), and up zero, right
on the x − axis.
Then is F (0, 2). This is right zero,
and up two, right on the y − axis.
Finally is G(0, 0). This point has no
movement. Thus the point is right on
the origin.

Our Solution
The main purpose of graphs is not to plot random points, but rather to give a
picture of the solutions to an equation. We may have an equation such as y =
2x − 3. We may be interested in what type of solution are possible in this equa-
tion. We can visualize the solution by making a graph of possible x and y combi-
nations that make this equation a true statement. We will have to start by
ﬁnding possible x and y combinations. We will do this using a table of values.
Example 121.
Graph y = 2x − 3
We make a table of values
x
y
− 1
0
1
We will test three values for x. Any three can be used
x
y
− 1 − 5
0
− 3

− 1
Evaluate each by replacing x with the given value
x = − 1; y = 2( − 1) − 3 = − 2 − 3 = − 5
x = 0; y = 2(0) − 3 = 0 − 3 = − 3
x = 1; y = 2(1) − 3 = 2 − 3 = − 1
( − 1, − 5), (0, − 3), (1, − 1)
These then become the points to graph on our equation
91
Plot each point.
Once the point are on the graph, con-
nect the dots to make a line.
The graph is our solution
What this line tells us is that any point on the line will work in the equation y =
2x − 3. For example, notice the graph also goes through the point (2, 1). If we use
x = 2, we should get y = 1. Sure enough, y = 2(2) − 3 = 4 − 3 = 1, just as the graph
suggests. Thus we have the line is a picture of all the solutions for y = 2x − 3. We
can use this table of values method to draw a graph of any linear equation.
Example 122.
Graph 2x − 3y = 6
We will use a table of values
x
y
− 3
0

We will test three values for x. Any three can be used.
2( − 3) − 3y = 6
Substitute each value in for x and solve for y
− 6 − 3y = 6
Start with x = − 3, multiply ﬁrst
+ 6
+ 6
Add 6 to both sides
− 3y = 12
Divide both sides by − 3
− 3 − 3
y = − 4
Solution for y when x = − 3, add this to table
2(0) − 3y = 6
Next x = 0
− 3y = 6
Multiplying clears the constant term
− 3 − 3
Divide each side by − 3
y = − 2
Solution for y when x = 0, add this to table
2(3) − 3y = 6
Next x = 3
6 − 3y = 6
Multiply
− 6
− 6
Subtract 9 from both sides
− 3y = 0
Divide each side by − 3

2.2
Graphing - Slope
Objective: Find the slope of a line given a graph or two points.
As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify diﬀerent properties of the
lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope
is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25, is very steep. A
line with a small slope, such as
1
10 is very ﬂat. We will also use slope to describe
the direction of the line. A line that goes up from left to right will have a positive
slope and a line that goes down from left to right will have a negative slope.
As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to
how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction rise
run.
Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the y-values. Run would be a hor-
izontal change, or a change in the x-values. So another way to describe slope
would be the fraction changein y
changeinx. It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw
vertical and horiztonal lines from one point to another to make what is called a
slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope. The following
examples show graphs that we ﬁnd the slope of using this idea.
Example 123.
Run 6
Rise − 4
To ﬁnd the slope of this line we will
consider the rise, or verticle change
and
the run
or
horizontal
change.
Drawing these lines in makes a slope
triangle that we can use to count from
one point to the next the graph goes
down 4, right 6. This is rise − 4, run
6.
As a fraction it would be,
− 4
6 .
Reduce the fraction to get − 2
3.
− 2
3 Our Solution
World View Note: When French mathematicians Rene Descartes and Pierre de
Fermat ﬁrst developed the coordinate plane and the idea of graphing lines (and
other functions) the y-axis was not a verticle line!
Example 124.
95
Rise 6
Run 3
To ﬁnd the slope of this line, the rise
is up 6, the run is right 3. Our slope is
then written as a fraction,
rise
run or
6
3.
This fraction reduces to 2. This will
be our slope.
2
Our Solution
There are two special lines that have unique slopes that we need to be aware of.
They are illustrated in the following example.
Example 125.
In this graph there is no rise, but the
run is 3 units. This slope becomes
0
3
=
0.
This
line,
and all horizontal lines have a zero slope.
This line has a rise of 5, but no run.
The
slope
becomes
5
0
=
undeﬁned.
This
line,
and all vertical lines, have no slope.
As you can see there is a big diﬀerence between having a zero slope and having no
slope or undeﬁned slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The ﬁrst
slope is not steep at all, in fact it is ﬂat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The
second slope can’t get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large
enough to express how steep it is. This is an undeﬁned slope.
We can ﬁnd the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a
graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in y values,
we can calculate this by subtracting the y values of a point. Similarly, if run is a
change in the x values, we can calculate this by subtracting the x values of a
point. In this way we get the following equation for slope.
The slope of a line through (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is y2 − y1
x2 − x1
96
When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope.
For this reason we often represent the slope with the variable m. Now we have
the following for slope.
Slope = m = rise
run = change in y
change in x = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
As we subtract the y values and the x values when calculating slope it is impor-
tant we subtract them in the same order. This process is shown in the following
examples.
Example 126.
Find the slope between ( − 4, 3) and (2, − 9)
Identify x1, y1, x2, y2
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
Use slope formula, m = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
m = − 9 − 3
2 − ( − 4)
Simplify
m = − 12
6
Reduce
m = − 2
Our Solution
Example 127.
Find the slope between (4,
6) and (2, − 1)
Identify x1, y1, x2, y2
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
Use slope formula, m = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
m = − 1 − 6
2 − 4
Simplify
m = − 7
− 2
Reduce, dividing by − 1
m = 7
2
Our Solution
We may come up against a problem that has a zero slope (horiztonal line) or no
slope (vertical line) just as with using the graphs.
Example 128.
Find the slope between ( − 4, − 1) and ( − 4, − 5)
Identify x1, y1, x2, y2
97
(x1 , y1) and
(x2, y2)
Use slope formula, m = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
m = − 5 − ( − 1)
− 4 − ( − 4)
Simplify
m = − 4
0
Can′t divide by zero, undeﬁned
m = no slope
Our Solution
Example 129.
Find the slope between (3, 1) and ( − 2, 1)
Identify x1, y1, x2, y2
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
Use slope formula, m = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
m = 1 − 1
− 2 − 3
Simplify
m = 0
− 5
Reduce
m = 0
Our Solution
Again, there is a big diﬀerence between no slope and a zero slope. Zero is an
integer and it has a value, the slope of a ﬂat horizontal line. No slope has no
value, it is undeﬁned, the slope of a vertical line.
Using the slope formula we can also ﬁnd missing points if we know what the slope
is. This is shown in the following two examples.
Example 130.
Find the value of y between the points (2, y) and (5, − 1) with slope − 3
m = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
We will plug values into slope formula
− 3 = − 1 − y
5 − 2
Simplify
− 3 = − 1 − y

Multiply both sides by 3
− 3(3) = − 1 − y

Simplify
− 9 = − 1 − y
Add 1 to both sides

Divide both sides by − 1

Our Solution

Example 131.

m = y2 − y1

Graphing - Slope-Intercept Form
Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and y-inter-
cept.
When graphing a line we found one method we could use is to make a table of
values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to
make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is ﬁnding the slope and
the y-intercept of the equation. The slope can be represented by m and the y-
intercept, where it crosses the axis and x = 0, can be represented by (0, b) where b
is the value where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis. Any other point on the
line can be represented by (x, y). Using this information we will look at the slope
formula and solve the formula for y.
Example 132.
m, (0, b), (x, y)
Using the slope formula gives:
y − b
x − 0 = m
Simplify
y − b
x
= m
Multiply both sides by x
y − b = mx
Add b to both sides
+ b
+ b
y = mx + b
Our Solution
This equation, y = mx + b can be thought of as the equation of any line that as a
slope of m and a y-intercept of b. This formula is known as the slope-intercept
equation.
Slope − Intercept Equation: y = mx + b
If we know the slope and the y-intercept we can easily ﬁnd the equation that rep-
resents the line.
Example 133.
Slope = 3
4, y − intercept = − 3
Use the slope − intercept equation
y = mx + b
m is the slope, b is the y − intercept
y = 3
4x − 3
Our Solution
We can also ﬁnd the equation by looking at a graph and ﬁnding the slope and y-
intercept.
Example 134.
102
Identify the point where the graph
crosses the y-axis (0,3). This means
the y-intercept is 3.
Idenﬁty one other point and draw a
slope triangle to ﬁnd the slope. The
slope is − 2
3
y = mx + b
Slope-intercept equation
y = − 2
3x + 3
Our Solution
We can also move the opposite direction, using the equation identify the slope
and y-intercept and graph the equation from this information. However, it will be
important for the equation to ﬁrst be in slope intercept form. If it is not, we will
have to solve it for y so we can identify the slope and the y-intercept.
Example 135.
Write in slope − intercept form: 2x − 4y = 6
Solve for y
− 2x
− 2x
Subtract 2x from both sides
− 4y = − 2x + 6
Put x term ﬁrst
− 4
− 4 − 4
Divide each term by − 4
y = 1
2x − 3
2
Our Solution
Once we have an equation in slope-intercept form we can graph it by ﬁrst plotting
the y-intercept, then using the slope, ﬁnd a second point and connecting the dots.
Example 136.
Graph y = 1
2x − 4
Recall the slope − intercept formula
y = mx + b
Idenﬁty the slope, m, and the y − intercept, b
m = 1
2, b = − 4
Make the graph
Starting with a point at the y-inter-
cept of − 4,
Then use the slope rise
run, so we will rise
1 unit and run 2 units to ﬁnd the next
point.
Once we have both points, connect the
dots to get our graph.
World View Note: Before our current system of graphing, French Mathemati-
cian Nicole Oresme, in 1323 sugggested graphing lines that would look more like a
103
bar graph with a constant slope!
Example 137.
Graph 3x + 4y = 12
Not in slope intercept form
− 3x
− 3x
Subtract 3x from both sides
4y = − 3x + 12
Put the x term ﬁrst
4
4
4
Divide each term by 4
y = − 3
4x + 3
Recall slope − intercept equation
y = mx + b
Idenﬁty m and b
m = − 3
4, b = 3
Make the graph
Starting with a point at the y-inter-
cept of 3,
Then use the slope
rise
run, but its nega-
tive so it will go downhill, so we will
drop 3 units and run 4 units to ﬁnd
the next point.
Once we have both points, connect the
dots to get our graph.
We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to ﬁnd the next point with
use a coordinate such as (4, − 2) to ﬁnd an individule point. Coordinates such as
(4, − 2) start from the origin and move horizontally ﬁrst, and vertically second.
Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The
numerator is the vertical change and the denominator is the horizontal change.
Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very diﬀerent. Zero
slope, or horiztonal line, will simply have a slope of zero which when multiplied
by x gives zero. So the equation simply becomes y = b or y is equal to the y-coor-
dinate of the graph. If we have no slope, or a vertical line, the equation can’t be
written in slope intercept at all because the slope is undeﬁned. There is no y in
these equations. We will simply make x equal to the x-coordinate of the graph.
Example 138.
Give the equation of the line in the
graph.
Because we have a vertical line and no
slope there is no slope-intercept equa-
tion we can use. Rather we make x
equal to the x-coordinate of − 4
x = − 4
Our Solution

Graphing - Point-Slope Form
Objective: Give the equation of a line with a known slope and point.
The slope-intercept form has the advantage of being simple to remember and use,
however, it has one major disadvantage: we must know the y-intercept in order to
use it! Generally we do not know the y-intercept, we only know one or more
points (that are not the y-intercept). In these cases we can’t use the slope inter-
cept equation, so we will use a diﬀerent more ﬂexible formula. If we let the slope
of an equation be m, and a speciﬁc point on the line be (x1, y1), and any other
point on the line be (x, y). We can use the slope formula to make a second equa-
tion.
Example 139.
m, (x1, y1), (x, y)
Recall slope formula
y2 − y1
x2 − x1 = m
Plug in values
y − y1
x − x1 = m
Multiply both sides by (x − x1)
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
Our Solution
If we know the slope, m of an equation and any point on the line (x1, y1) we can
easily plug these values into the equation above which will be called the point-
slope formula.
Point − Slope Formula: y − y1 = m(x − x1)
Example 140.
Write the equation of the line through the point (3, − 4) with a slope of 3
5.
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
Plug values into point − slope formula
y − ( − 4) = 3
5(x − 3)
Simplify signs
y + 4 = 3
5(x − 3)
Our Solution
Often, we will prefer ﬁnal answers be written in slope intercept form. If the direc-
107
tions ask for the answer in slope-intercept form we will simply distribute the
slope, then solve for y.
Example 141.
Write the equation of the line through the point ( − 6, 2) with a slope of − 2
3 in
slope-intercept form.
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
Plug values into point − slope formula
y − 2 = − 2
3(x − ( − 6))
Simplify signs
y − 2 = − 2
3(x + 6)
Distribute slope
y − 2 = − 2
3x − 4
Solve for y
+ 2
+ 2
y = − 2
3x − 2
Our Solution
An important thing to observe about the point slope formula is that the operation
between the x’s and y’s is subtraction. This means when you simplify the signs
you will have the opposite of the numbers in the point. We need to be very
careful with signs as we use the point-slope formula.
In order to ﬁnd the equation of a line we will always need to know the slope. If
we don’t know the slope to begin with we will have to do some work to ﬁnd it
ﬁrst before we can get an equation.
Example 142.
Find the equation of the line through the points ( − 2, 5) and (4, − 3).
m = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
First we must ﬁnd the slope
m = − 3 − 5
4 − ( − 2) = − 8
6 = − 4
3
Plug values in slope formula and evaluate
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
With slope and either point, use point − slope formula
y − 5 = − 4
3(x − ( − 2))
Simplify signs
y − 5 = − 4
3(x + 2)
Our Solution
Example 143.
108
Find the equation of the line through the points ( − 3, 4) and ( − 1, − 2) in slope-
intercept form.
m = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
First we must ﬁnd the slope
m =
− 2 − 4
− 1 − ( − 3) = − 6
2 = − 3
Plug values in slope formula and evaluate
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
With slope and either point, point − slope formula
y − 4 = − 3(x − ( − 3))
Simplify signs
y − 4 = − 3(x + 3)
Distribute slope
y − 4 = − 3x − 9
Solve for y
+ 4
+ 4
Add 4 to both sides
y = − 3x − 5
Our Solution
Example 144.
Find the equation of the line through the points (6, − 2) and ( − 4, 1) in slope-
intercept form.
m = y2 − y1
x2 − x1
First we must ﬁnd the slope
m = 1 − ( − 2)
− 4 − 6 =

− 10 = − 3

Plug values into slope formula and evaluate
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
Use slope and either point, use point − slope formula
y − ( − 2) = − 3
10(x − 6)
Simplify signs
y + 2 = − 3
10(x − 6)
Distribute slope
y + 2 = − 3
10x + 9

Solve for y. Subtract 2 from both sides

Our Solution
World View Note: The city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) had a
river that ﬂowed through the city breaking it into several parts. There were 7
bridges that connected the parts of the city. In 1735 Leonhard Euler considered
the question of whether it was possible to cross each bridge exactly once and only
once. It turned out that this problem was impossible, but the work laid the foun-
dation of what would become graph theory.

Graphing - Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Objective: Identify the equation of a line given a parallel or perpendic-
ular line.
There is an interesting connection between the slope of lines that are parallel and
the slope of lines that are perpendicular (meet at a right angle). This is shown in
the following example.
Example 145.
The
above
graph
has
two
parallel
lines.
The slope of the top line is
down 2, run 3, or
− 2
3. The slope of
the bottom line is down 2, run 3 as
well, or − 2
3.
The above graph has two perpendic-
ular lines. The slope of the ﬂatter line
is
up
2,
run
3
or
2
3. The slope of the steeper line is down 3,
run 2 or − 3
2.
World View Note: Greek Mathematician Euclid lived around 300 BC and pub-
lished a book titled, The Elements. In it is the famous parallel postulate which
mathematicians have tried for years to drop from the list of postulates. The
attempts have failed, yet all the work done has developed new types of geome-
tries!
As the above graphs illustrate, parallel lines have the same slope and perpendic-
ular lines have opposite (one positive, one negative) reciprocal (ﬂipped fraction)
slopes. We can use these properties to make conclusions about parallel and per-
pendicular lines.
Example 146.
Find the slope of a line parallel to 5y − 2x = 7.
5y − 2x = 7
To ﬁnd the slope we will put equation in slope − intercept form
+ 2x + 2x
Add 2x to both sides
5y = 2x + 7
Put x term ﬁrst

Divide each term by 5

Our Solution
Example 147.
Find the slope of a line perpendicular to 3x − 4y = 2
3x − 4y = 2
To ﬁnd slope we will put equation in slope − intercept form

Our Solution
Once we have a slope, it is possible to ﬁnd the complete equation of the second
line if we know one point on the second line.
Example 148.
Find the equation of a line through (4, − 5) and parallel to 2x − 3y = 6.
2x − 3y = 6
We ﬁrst need slope of parallel line
− 2x
− 2x
Subtract 2x from each side
− 3y = − 2x + 6
Put x term ﬁrst

Divide each term by − 3

3x − 2
Identify the slope, the coeﬃcient of x
m = 2
3
Parallel lines have the same slope
m = 2
3
We will use this slope and our point (4, − 5)
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
Plug this information into point slope formula
y − ( − 5) = 2
3(x − 4)
Simplify signs
y + 5 = 2
3(x − 4)
Our Solution
113
Example 149.
Find the equation of the line through (6, − 9) perpendicular to y = − 3
5x + 4 in
slope-intercept form.
y = − 3
5x + 4
Identify the slope, coeﬃcient of x
m = − 3
5
Perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes
m = 5
3
We will use this slope and our point (6, − 9)
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
Plug this information into point − slope formula
y − ( − 9) = 5
3(x − 6)
Simplify signs
y + 9 = 5
3(x − 6)
Distribute slope
y + 9 = 5
3x − 10
Solve for y
− 9
− 9
Subtract 9 from both sides
y = 5
3x − 19
Our Solution
Zero slopes and no slopes may seem like opposites (one is a horizontal line, one is
a vertical line). Because a horizontal line is perpendicular to a vertical line we can
say that no slope and zero slope are actually perpendicular slopes!
Example 150.
Find the equation of the line through (3, 4) perpendicular to x = − 2
x = − 2
This equation has no slope, a vertical line
no slope
Perpendicular line then would have a zero slope
m = 0
Use this and our point (3, 4)
y − y1 = m(x − x1)
Plug this information into point − slope formula
y − 4 = 0(x − 3)
Distribute slope
y − 4 = 0
Solve for y
+ 4 + 4
Add 4 to each side
y = 4
Our Solution
Being aware that to be perpendicular to a vertical line means we have a hori-
zontal line through a y value of 4, thus we could have jumped from this point
right to the solution, y = 4.

Inequalities - Solve and Graph Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution to
linear inequalities.
When we have an equation such as x = 4 we have a speciﬁc value for our variable.
With inequalities we will give a range of values for our variable. To do this we
will not use equals, but one of the following symbols:
>
Greater than
⩾
Greater than or equal to
<
Less than
⩽
Less than or equal to
World View Note: English mathematician Thomas Harriot ﬁrst used the above
symbols in 1631. However, they were not immediately accepted as symbols such
as
⊏
and
⊐ were already coined by another English mathematician, William
Oughtred.
If we have an expression such as x < 4, this means our variable can be any number
smaller than 4 such as − 2, 0, 3, 3.9 or even 3.999999999 as long as it is smaller
118
than 4. If we have an expression such as x ⩾ − 2, this means our variable can be
any number greater than or equal to − 2, such as 5, 0, − 1, − 1.9999, or even − 2.
Because we don’t have one set value for our variable, it is often useful to draw a
picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. We will start from the
value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is
smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the vari-
able is larger. The value itself we will mark with brackets, either ) or ( for less
than or greater than respectively, and ] or [ for less than or equal to or greater
than or equal to respectively.
Once the graph is drawn we can quickly convert the graph into what is called
interval notation. Interval notation gives two numbers, the ﬁrst is the smallest
value, the second is the largest value. If there is no largest value, we can use ∞
(inﬁnity). If there is no smallest value, we can use − ∞ negative inﬁnity. If we
use either positive or negative inﬁnity we will always use a curved bracket for that
value.
Example 151.
Graph the inequality and give the interval notation
x < 2
Start at 2 and shade below
Use ) for less than
Our Graph
( − ∞, 2)
Interval Notation
Example 152.
Graph the inequality and give the interval notation
y ⩾ − 1
Start at − 1 and shade above
Use [ for greater than or equal
Our Graph
[ − 1, ∞)
Interval Notation
We can also take a graph and ﬁnd the inequality for it.
119
Example 153.
Give the inequality for the graph:
Graph starts at 3 and goes up or greater. Curved bracket means just greater than
x > 3
Our Solution
Example 154.
Give the inequality for the graph:
Graph starts at
− 4 and goes down or less. Square bracket means less than or
equal to
x ⩽ − 4
Our Solution
Generally when we are graphing and giving interval notation for an inequality we
will have to ﬁrst solve the inequality for our variable. Solving inequalities is very
similar to solving equations with one exception. Consider the following inequality
and what happens when various operations are done to it. Notice what happens
to the inequality sign as we add, subtract, multiply and divide by both positive
and negative numbers to keep the statment a true statement.
5 > 1
Add 3 to both sides
8 > 4
Subtract 2 from both sides
6 > 2
Multiply both sides by 3
12 > 6
Divide both sides by 2
6 > 3
Add − 1 to both sides
5 > 2
Subtract − 4 from both sides
9 > 6
Multiply both sides by − 2
− 18 < − 12
Divide both sides by − 6
3 > 2
Symbol ﬂipped when we multiply or divide by a negative!
As the above problem illustrates, we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide on
both sides of the inequality. But if we multiply or divide by a negative number,
the symbol will need to ﬂip directions. We will keep that in mind as we solve
inequalities.
Example 155.
Solve and give interval notation
5 − 2x ⩾ 11
Subtract 5 from both sides
120
− 5
− 5
− 2x ⩾ 6
Divide both sides by − 2
− 2 − 2
Divide by a negative − ﬂip symbol!
x ⩽ − 3
Graph, starting at − 3, going down with ] for less than or equal to
( − ∞, − 3]
Interval Notation
The inequality we solve can get as complex as the linear equations we solved. We
will use all the same patterns to solve these inequalities as we did for solving
equations. Just remember that any time we multiply or divide by a negative the
symbol switches directions (multiplying or dividing by a positive does not change
the symbol!)
Example 156.
Solve and give interval notation
3(2x − 4) + 4x < 4(3x − 7) + 8
Distribute
6x − 12 + 4x < 12x − 28 + 8
Combine like terms
10x − 12 < 12x − 20
Move variable to one side
− 10x
− 10x
Subtract 10x from both sides
− 12 < 2x − 20
Add 20 to both sides
+ 20
+ 20
8 < 2x
Divide both sides by 2
2
2
4 < x
Be careful with graph, x is larger!
(4, ∞)
Interval Notation
It is important to be careful when the inequality is written backwards as in the
previous example (4 < x rather than x > 4). Often students draw their graphs the
wrong way when this is the case. The inequality symbol opens to the variable,
this means the variable is greater than 4. So we must shade above the 4.

Inequalities - Compound Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation to the solution of
compound inequalities.
Several inequalities can be combined together to form what are called compound
inequalities. There are three types of compound inequalities which we will investi-
gate in this lesson.
The ﬁrst type of a compound inequality is an OR inequality. For this type of
inequality we want a true statment from either one inequality OR the other
inequality OR both. When we are graphing these type of inequalities we will
graph each individual inequality above the number line, then move them both
down together onto the actual number line for our graph that combines them
together.
When we give interval notation for our solution, if there are two diﬀerent parts to
the graph we will put a ∪ (union) symbol between two sets of interval notation,
one for each part.
Example 157.
Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and give interval notation of solution

World View Note: The symbol for inﬁnity was ﬁrst used by the Romans,
although at the time the number was used for 1000. The greeks also used the
symbol for 10,000.
There are several diﬀerent results that could result from an OR statement. The
graphs could be pointing diﬀerent directions, as in the graph above, or pointing in
the same direction as in the graph below on the left, or pointing opposite direc-
tions, but overlapping as in the graph below on the right. Notice how interval
notation works for each of these cases.
124
As the graphs overlap, we take the
largest graph for our solution.
Interval Notation: ( − ∞, 1)
When the graphs are combined they
cover the entire number line.
Interval Notation: ( − ∞, ∞) or R
The second type of compound inequality is an AND inequality. AND inequalities
require both statements to be true. If one is false, they both are false. When we
graph these inequalities we can follow a similar process, ﬁrst graph both inequali-
ties above the number line, but this time only where they overlap will be drawn
onto the number line for our ﬁnal graph. When our solution is given in interval
notation it will be expressed in a manner very similar to single inequalities (there
is a symbol that can be used for AND, the intersection - ∩ , but we will not use it
here).
Example 158.
Solve each inequality, graph the solution, and express it interval notation.
2x + 8 ⩾ 5x − 7 and 5x − 3 > 3x + 1
Move variables to one side
− 2x

and
x > 2

Interval Notation
Again, as we graph AND inequalities, only the overlapping parts of the individual
graphs makes it to the ﬁnal number line. As we graph AND inequalities there are
also three diﬀerent types of results we could get. The ﬁrst is shown in the above
125
example. The second is if the arrows both point the same way, this is shown
below on the left. The third is if the arrows point opposite ways but don’t
overlap, this is shown below on the right. Notice how interval notation is
expressed in each case.
In this graph, the overlap is only the
smaller graph, so this is what makes it
to the ﬁnal number line.
Interval Notation: ( − ∞, − 2)
In this graph there is no overlap of the
parts. Because their is no overlap, no
values make it to the ﬁnal number
line.
Interval Notation: No Solution or ∅
The third type of compound inequality is a special type of AND inequality. When
our variable (or expression containing the variable) is between two numbers, we
can write it as a single math sentence with three parts, such as 5 < x ⩽ 8, to show
x is between 5 and 8 (or equal to 8). When solving these type of inequalities,
because there are three parts to work with, to stay balanced we will do the same
thing to all three parts (rather than just both sides) to isolate the variable in the
middle. The graph then is simply the values between the numbers with appro-
priate brackets on the ends.

Inequalities - Absolute Value Inequalities
Objective: Solve, graph and give interval notation for the solution to
inequalities with absolute values.
When an inequality has an absolute value we will have to remove the absolute
value in order to graph the solution or give interval notation. The way we remove
the absolute value depends on the direction of the inequality symbol.
Consider |x| < 2.
Absolute value is deﬁned as distance from zero. Another way to read this
inequality would be the distance from zero is less than 2. So on a number line we
will shade all points that are less than 2 units away from zero.
This graph looks just like the graphs of the three part compound inequalities!
When the absolute value is less than a number we will remove the absolute value
by changing the problem to a three part inequality, with the negative value on the
left and the positive value on the right. So |x| < 2 becomes − 2 < x < 2, as the
graph above illustrates.
Consider |x| > 2.
Absolute value is deﬁned as distance from zero. Another way to read this
inequality would be the distance from zero is greater than 2. So on the number
line we shade all points that are more than 2 units away from zero.
This graph looks just like the graphs of the OR compound inequalities! When the
absolute value is greater than a number we will remove the absolute value by
changing the problem to an OR inequality, the ﬁrst inequality looking just like
the problem with no absolute value, the second ﬂipping the inequality symbol and
changing the value to a negative. So |x| > 2 becomes x > 2 or x < − 2, as the graph
above illustrates.
World View Note: The phrase “absolute value” comes from German mathemati-
cian Karl Weierstrass in 1876, though he used the absolute value symbol for com-
plex numbers. The ﬁrst known use of the symbol for integers comes from a 1939
128
edition of a college algebra text!
For all absolute value inequalities we can also express our answers in interval
notation which is done the same way it is done for standard compound inequali-
ties.
We can solve absolute value inequalities much like we solved absolute value equa-
tions. Our ﬁrst step will be to isolate the absolute value. Next we will remove the
absolute value by making a three part inequality if the absolute value is less than
a number, or making an OR inequality if the absolute value is greater than a
number. Then we will solve these inequalites. Remember, if we multiply or divide
by a negative the inequality symbol will switch directions!
Example 160.
Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution
|4x − 5| ⩾ 6
Absolute value is greater, use OR
4x − 5 ⩾ 6 OR 4x − 5 ⩽ − 6

Interval Notation
In the previous example, we cannot combine − 4 and − 3 because they are not like
terms, the − 3 has an absolute value attached. So we must ﬁrst clear the − 4 by
adding 4, then divide by − 3. The next example is similar.
Example 162.
Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution
9 − 2|4x + 1| > 3
Subtract 9 from both sides
− 9

− 2|4x + 1| > − 6

Interval Notation
In the previous example, we cannot distribute the
− 2 into the absolute value.
We can never distribute or combine things outside the absolute value with what is
inside the absolute value. Our only way to solve is to ﬁrst isolate the absolute
value by clearing the values around it, then either make a compound inequality
(and OR or a three part) to solve.
130
It is important to remember as we are solving these equations, the absolute value
is always positive. If we end up with an absolute value is less than a negative
number, then we will have no solution because absolute value will always be posi-
tive, greater than a negative. Similarly, if absolute value is greater than a nega-
tive, this will always happen. Here the answer will be all real numbers.

Solve, graph, and give interval notation for the solution
12 + 4|6x − 1| < 4

Systems of Equations - Graphing
Objective: Solve systems of equations by graphing and identifying the
point of intersection.
We have solved problems like 3x − 4 = 11 by adding 4 to both sides and then
dividing by 3 (solution is x = 5). We also have methods to solve equations with
more than one variable in them. It turns out that to solve for more than one vari-
able we will need the same number of equations as variables. For example, to
solve for two variables such as x and y we will need two equations. When we have
several equations we are using to solve, we call the equations a system of equa-
tions. When solving a system of equations we are looking for a solution that
works in both equations. This solution is usually given as an ordered pair (x, y).
The following example illustrates a solution working in both equations
Example 165.
Show (2,1) is the solution to the system 3x − y = 5
x + y = 3
(2, 1)
Identify x and y from the orderd pair
x = 2, y = 1
Plug these values into each equation
3(2) − (1) = 5
First equation
6 − 1 = 5
Evaluate
5 = 5
True
(2) + (1) = 3
Second equation, evaluate
3 = 3
True
As we found a true statement for both equations we know (2,1) is the solution to
the system. It is in fact the only combination of numbers that works in both
equations. In this lesson we will be working to ﬁnd this point given the equations.
It seems to follow that if we use points to describe the solution, we can use graphs
to ﬁnd the solutions.
If the graph of a line is a picture of all the solutions, we can graph two lines on
the same coordinate plane to see the solutions of both equations. We are inter-
134
ested in the point that is a solution for both lines, this would be where the lines
intersect! If we can ﬁnd the intersection of the lines we have found the solution
that works in both equations.
Example 166.
y = − 1
2x + 3
y = 3
4x − 2
To graph we identify slopes and y − intercepts
First: m = − 1
2, b = 3
Second: m = 3
4, b = − 2
Now we can graph both lines on the same plane.
(4,1)
To graph each equation, we start at
the y-intercept and use the slope
rise
run
to get the next point and connect the
dots.
Remember a negative slope is down-
hill!
Find the intersection point, (4,1)
(4,1)
Our Solution
Often our equations won’t be in slope-intercept form and we will have to solve
both equations for y ﬁrst so we can idenﬁty the slope and y-intercept.
Example 167.
6x − 3y = − 9
2x + 2y = − 6
Solve each equation for y
6x − 3y = − 9
2x + 2y = − 6
− 6x
− 6x
− 2x
− 2x
Subtract x terms
− 3y = − 6x − 9
2y = − 2x − 6
Put x terms ﬁrst
− 3
− 3 − 3

2
Divide by coeﬃcient of y
y = 2x + 3
y = − x − 3
Identify slope and y − intercepts
135
First: m = 2
1, b = 3
Second: m = − 1
1, b = − 3
Now we can graph both lines on the same plane
(-2,-1)
To graph each equation, we start at
the y-intercept and use the slope
rise
run
to get the next point and connect the
dots.
Remember a negative slope is down-
hill!
Find the intersection point, ( − 2, − 1)
( − 2, − 1)
Our Solution
As we are graphing our lines, it is possible to have one of two unexpected results.
These are shown and discussed in the next two example.
Example 168.
y = 3
2x − 4
y = 3
2x + 1
Identify slope and y − intercept of each equation
First: m = 3
2, b = − 4
Second: m = 3
2, b = 1
Now we can graph both equations on the same plane
To graph each equation, we start at
the y-intercept and use the slope
rise
run
to get the next point and connect the
dots.
The two lines do not intersect! They
are parallel! If the lines do not inter-
sect we know that there is no point
that works in both equations, there is
no solution
∅ No Solution
We also could have noticed that both lines had the same slope. Remembering
136
that parallel lines have the same slope we would have known there was no solu-
tion even without having to graph the lines.
Example 169.
2x − 6y = 12
3x − 9y = 18
Solve each equation for y
2x − 6y = 12
3x − 9y = 18
− 2x
− 2x
− 3x
− 3x
Subtract x terms
− 6y = − 2x + 12
− 9y = − 3x + 18
Put x terms ﬁrst
− 6
− 6 − 6
− 9
− 9 − 9
Divide by coeﬃcient of y
y = 1
3x − 2
y = 1
3x − 2
Identify the slopes and y − intercepts
First: m = 1
3, b = − 2
Second: m = 1
3, b = − 2
Now we can graph both equations together
To graph each equation, we start at
the y-intercept and use the slope
rise
run
to get the next point and connect the
dots.
Both equations are the same line! As
one line is directly on top of the other
line, we can say that the lines “inter-
sect” at all the points! Here we say we
have inﬁnite solutions
Once we had both equations in slope-intercept form we could have noticed that
the equations were the same. At this point we could have stated that there are
inﬁnite solutions without having to go through the work of graphing the equa-
tions.
World View Note: The Babylonians were the ﬁrst to work with systems of
equations with two variables. However, their work with systems was quickly
passed by the Greeks who would solve systems of equations with three or four
variables and around 300 AD, developed methods for solving systems with any
number of unknowns!

Systems of Equations - Substitution
Objective: Solve systems of equations using substitution.
When solving a system by graphing has several limitations. First, it requires the
graph to be perfectly drawn, if the lines are not straight we may arrive at the
wrong answer. Second, graphing is not a great method to use if the answer is
really large, over 100 for example, or if the answer is a decimal the that graph will
not help us ﬁnd, 3.2134 for example. For these reasons we will rarely use graphing
to solve our systems. Instead, an algebraic approach will be used.
The ﬁrst algebraic approach is called substitution. We will build the concepts of
substitution through several example, then end with a ﬁve-step process to solve
problems using this method.
Example 170.
x = 5
y = 2x − 3
We already know x = 5, substitute this into the other equation
y = 2(5) − 3
Evaluate, multiply ﬁrst
y = 10 − 3
Subtract
y = 7
We now also have y
(5, 7)
Our Solution
When we know what one variable equals we can plug that value (or expression) in
for the variable in the other equation. It is very important that when we substi-
tute, the substituted value goes in parenthesis. The reason for this is shown in the
next example.
Example 171.
2x − 3y = 7
y = 3x − 7
We know y = 3x − 7, substitute this into the other equation
2x − 3(3x − 7) = 7
Solve this equation, distributing − 3 ﬁrst
139
2x − 9x + 21 = 7
Combine like terms 2x − 9x
− 7x + 21 = 7
Subtract 21
− 21 − 21
− 7x = − 14
Divide by − 7
− 7
− 7
x = 2
We now have our x, plug into the y = equation to ﬁnd y
y = 3(2) − 7
Evaluate, multiply ﬁrst
y = 6 − 7
Subtract
y = − 1
We now also have y
(2, − 1)
Our Solution
By using the entire expression 3x − 7 to replace y in the other equation we were
able to reduce the system to a single linear equation which we can easily solve for
our ﬁrst variable. However, the lone variable (a variable without a coeﬃcient) is
not always alone on one side of the equation. If this happens we can isolate it by
solving for the lone variable.
Example 172.
3x + 2y = 1
x − 5y = 6
Lone variable is x, isolate by adding 5y to both sides.
+ 5y + 5y
x = 6 + 5y
Substitute this into the untouched equation
3(6 + 5y) + 2y = 1
Solve this equation, distributing 3 ﬁrst
18 + 15y + 2y = 1
Combine like terms 15y + 2y
18 + 17y = 1
Subtract 18 from both sides
− 18
− 18
17y = − 17
Divide both sides by 17
17
17
y = − 1
We have our y, plug this into the x = equation to ﬁnd x
x = 6 + 5( − 1)
Evaluate, multiply ﬁrst
x = 6 − 5
Subtract
x = 1
We now also have x
(1, − 1)
Our Solution
The process in the previous example is how we will solve problems using substitu-
140
tion. This process is described and illustrated in the following table which lists
the ﬁve steps to solving by substitution.
Problem
4x − 2y = 2
2x + y = − 5
1. Find the lone variable
Second Equation, y
2x + y = − 5
2. Solve for the lone variable
− 2x
− 2x
y = − 5 − 2x
3. Substitute into the untouched equation
4x − 2( − 5 − 2x) = 2
4. Solve
4x + 10 + 4x = 2
8x + 10 = 2
− 10 − 10
8x = − 8

8
x = − 1
5. Plug into lone variable equation and evaluate
y = − 5 − 2( − 1)
y = − 5 + 2
y = − 3
Solution
( − 1, − 3)
Sometimes we have several lone variables in a problem. In this case we will have
the choice on which lone variable we wish to solve for, either will give the same
ﬁnal result.
Example 173.
x + y = 5
x − y = − 1
Find the lone variable: x or y in ﬁrst, or x in second.
We will chose x in the ﬁrst
x + y = 5
Solve for the lone variable, subtract y from both sides
− y − y
x = 5 − y
Plug into the untouched equation, the second equation
(5 − y) − y = − 1
Solve, parenthesis are not needed here, combine like terms
5 − 2y = − 1
Subtract 5 from both sides
− 5
− 5
− 2y = − 6
Divide both sides by − 2
− 2
− 2
y = 3
We have our y!
x = 5 − (3)
Plug into lone variable equation, evaluate
x = 2
Now we have our x
141
(2, 3)
Our Solution
Just as with graphing it is possible to have no solution ∅ (parallel lines) or
inﬁnite solutions (same line) with the substitution method. While we won’t have
a parallel line or the same line to look at and conclude if it is one or the other,
the process takes an interesting turn as shown in the following example.
Example 174.
y + 4 = 3x
2y − 6x = − 8
Find the lone variable, y in the ﬁrst equation
y + 4 = 3x
Solve for the lone variable, subtract 4 from both sides
− 4 − 4
y = 3x − 4
Plug into untouched equation
2(3x − 4) − 6x = − 8
Solve, distribute through parenthesis
6x − 8 − 6x = − 8
Combine like terms 6x − 6x
− 8 = − 8
Variables are gone!A true statement.
Inﬁnite solutions
Our Solution
Because we had a true statement, and no variables, we know that anything that
works in the ﬁrst equation, will also work in the second equation. However, we do
not always end up with a true statement.
Example 175.
6x − 3y = − 9
− 2x + y = 5
Find the lone variable, y in the second equation
− 2x + y = 5
Solve for the lone variable, add 2x to both sides
+ 2x
+ 2x
y = 5 + 2x
Plug into untouched equation
6x − 3(5 + 2x) = − 9
Solve, distribute through parenthesis
6x − 15 − 6x = − 9
Combine like terms 6x − 6x
− 15
� − 9
Variables are gone!A false statement.
No Solution ∅
Our Solution
Because we had a false statement, and no variables, we know that nothing will
work in both equations.

World View Note: French mathematician Rene Descartes wrote a book which
included an appendix on geometry. It was in this book that he suggested using
letters from the end of the alphabet for unknown values. This is why often we are
solving for the variables x, y, and z.
One more question needs to be considered, what if there is no lone variable? If
there is no lone variable substitution can still work to solve, we will just have to
select one variable to solve for and use fractions as we solve.
Example 176.
5x − 6y = − 14
− 2x + 4y = 12
No lone variable,
we will solve for x in the ﬁrst equation
5x − 6y = − 14
Solve for our variable, add 6y to both sides
+ 6y + 6y
5x = − 14 + 6y
Divide each term by 5

Reduce fractions and multiply

Subtract 28 from both sides

Using the fractions does make the problem a bit more tricky. This is why we have
another method for solving systems of equations that will be discussed in another
lesson.

Systems of Equations - Addition/Elimination
Objective: Solve systems of equations using the addition/elimination
method.
When solving systems we have found that graphing is very limited when solving
equations. We then considered a second method known as substituion. This is
probably the most used idea in solving systems in various areas of algebra. How-
ever, substitution can get ugly if we don’t have a lone variable. This leads us to
our second method for solving systems of equations. This method is known as
either Elimination or Addition. We will set up the process in the following exam-
ples, then deﬁne the ﬁve step process we can use to solve by elimination.
Example 177.
3x − 4y = 8
5x + 4y = − 24
Notice opposites in front of y′s. Add columns.
8x
= − 16
Solve for x, divide by 8

x = − 2
We have our x!
5( − 2) + 4y = − 24
Plug into either original equation, simplify
− 10 + 4y = − 24
Add 10 to both sides
+ 10
+ 10
4y = − 14
Divide by 4

Now we have our y!

Our Solution
In the previous example one variable had opposites in front of it, − 4y and 4y.
Adding these together eliminated the y completely. This allowed us to solve for
the x. This is the idea behind the addition method. However, generally we won’t
have opposites in front of one of the variables. In this case we will manipulate the
equations to get the opposites we want by multiplying one or both equations (on
both sides!). This is shown in the next example.
Example 178.
− 6x + 5y = 22
2x + 3y = 2
We can get opposites in front of x, by multiplying the
second equation by 3, to get − 6x and + 6x
3(2x + 3y) = (2)3
Distribute to get new second equation.
146
6x + 9y = 6
New second equation
− 6x + 5y = 22
First equation still the same, add
14y = 28
Divide both sides by 14
14
14
y = 2
We have our y!
2x + 3(2) = 2
Plug into one of the original equations, simplify
2x + 6 = 2
Subtract 6 from both sides
− 6 − 6
2x = − 4
Divide both sides by 2
2
2
x = − 2
We also have our x!
( − 2, 2)
Our Solution
When we looked at the x terms, − 6x and 2x we decided to multiply the 2x by 3
to get the opposites we were looking for. What we are looking for with our oppo-
sites is the least common multiple (LCM) of the coeﬃcients. We also could have
solved the above problem by looking at the terms with y, 5y and 3y. The LCM of
3 and 5 is 15. So we would want to multiply both equations, the 5y by 3, and the
3y by − 5 to get opposites, 15y and − 15y. This illustrates an important point,
some problems we will have to multiply both equations by a constant (on both
sides) to get the opposites we want.
Example 179.
3x + 6y = − 9
2x + 9y = − 26
We can get opposites in front of x, ﬁnd LCM of 6 and 9,
The LCM is 18. We will multiply to get 18y and − 18y
3(3x + 6y) = ( − 9)3
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by 3, both sides!
9x + 18y = − 27
− 2(2x + 9y) = ( − 26)( − 2)
Multiply the second equation by − 2, both sides!
− 4x − 18y = 52
9x + 18y = − 27
Add two new equations together
− 4x − 18y = 52
5x
= 25
Divide both sides by 5
5
5
x = 5
We have our solution for x
3(5) + 6y = − 9
Plug into either original equation, simplify
15 + 6y = − 9
Subtract 15 from both sides
− 15
− 15
147
6y = − 24
Divide both sides by 6

y = − 4
Now we have our solution for y
(5, − 4)
Our Solution
It is important for each problem as we get started that all variables and constants
are lined up before we start multiplying and adding equations. This is illustrated
in the next example which includes the ﬁve steps we will go through to solve a
problem using elimination.

World View Note: The famous mathematical text, The Nine Chapters on the
Mathematical Art, which was printed around 179 AD in China describes a for-
mula very similar to Gaussian elimination which is very similar to the addition
method.

Just as with graphing and substution, it is possible to have no solution or inﬁnite
solutions with elimination. Just as with substitution, if the variables all disappear
from our problem, a true statment will indicate inﬁnite solutions and a false stat-
ment will indicate no solution.
Example 180.
2x − 5y = 3
− 6x + 15y = − 9
To get opposites in front of x, multiply ﬁrst equation by 3
3(2x − 5y) = (3)3

Multiply ﬁrst equation by 3
12x − 18y = 24
− 2(6x − 9y) = (15)( − 2)
Multiply second equation by − 2
− 12x + 18y = − 30
12x − 18y = 24

Our Solution
We have covered three diﬀerent methods that can be used to solve a system of
two equations with two variables. While all three can be used to solve any
system, graphing works great for small integer solutions. Substitution works great
when we have a lone variable, and addition works great when the other two
methods fail. As each method has its own strengths, it is important you are
familiar with all three methods.

Systems of Equations - Three Variables
Objective: Solve systems of equations with three variables using addi-
tion/elimination.
Solving systems of equations with 3 variables is very similar to how we solve sys-
tems with two variables. When we had two variables we reduced the system down
to one with only one variable (by substitution or addition). With three variables
we will reduce the system down to one with two variables (usually by addition),
which we can then solve by either addition or substitution.
To reduce from three variables down to two it is very important to keep the work
organized. We will use addition with two equations to eliminate one variable.
This new equation we will call (A). Then we will use a diﬀerent pair of equations
and use addition to eliminate the same variable. This second new equation we
will call (B). Once we have done this we will have two equations (A) and (B)
with the same two variables that we can solve using either method. This is shown
in the following examples.
Example 182.
3x + 2y − z = − 1
− 2x − 2y + 3z = 5
We will eliminate y using two diﬀerent pairs of equations
5x + 2y − z = 3
151
3x + 2y − z = − 1
Using the ﬁrst two equations,
− 2x − 2y + 3z = 5
Add the ﬁrst two equations
(A)
x
+ 2z = 4
This is equation (A), our ﬁrst equation
− 2x − 2y + 3z = 5
Using the second two equations
5x + 2y − z = 3
Add the second two equations
(B)
3x
+ 2z = 8
This is equation (B), our second equation
(A) x + 2z = 4
Using (A) and (B) we will solve this system.
(B) 3x + 2z = 8
We will solve by addition
− 1(x + 2z) = (4)( − 1)
Multiply (A) by − 1
− x − 2z = − 4
− x − 2z = − 4
Add to the second equation, unchanged
3x + 2z = 8
2x = 4
Solve, divide by 2
2
2
x = 2
We now have x! Plug this into either (A) or (B)
(2) + 2z = 4
We plug it into (A), solve this equation, subtract 2
− 2
− 2
2z = 2
Divide by 2
2
2
z = 1
We now have z! Plug this and x into any original equation
3(2) + 2y − (1) = − 1
We use the ﬁrst, multiply 3(2) = 6 and combine with − 1
2y + 5 = − 1
Solve, subtract 5
− 5
− 5
2y = − 6
Divide by 2
2
2
y = − 3
We now have y!
(2, − 3, 1)
Our Solution
As we are solving for x, y, and z we will have an ordered triplet (x, y, z) instead of
152
just the ordered pair (x, y). In this above problem, y was easily eliminated using
the addition method. However, sometimes we may have to do a bit of work to get
a variable to eliminate. Just as with addition of two equations, we may have to
multiply equations by something on both sides to get the opposites we want so a
variable eliminates. As we do this remmeber it is improtant to eliminate the
same variable both times using two diﬀerent pairs of equations.
Example 183.
4x − 3y + 2z = − 29
No variable will easily eliminate.
6x + 2y − z = − 16
We could choose any variable, so we chose x
− 8x − y + 3z = 23
We will eliminate x twice.
4x − 3y + 2z = − 29
Start withﬁrsttwoequations.LCM of4 and6is12.

Make the ﬁrst equation have 12x, the second − 12x

Multiply the ﬁrst equation by 3
12x − 9y + 6z = − 87
− 2(6x + 2y − z) = ( − 16)( − 2)
Multiply the second equation by − 2
− 12x − 4y + 2z = 32
12x − 9y + 6z = − 87
Add these two equations together
− 12x − 4y + 2z = 32

This is our (A) equation
6x + 2y − z = − 16
Now use the second two equations (a diﬀerent pair)

The LCM of 6 and − 8 is 24.
4(6x + 2y − z) = ( − 16)4
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by 4
24x + 8y − 4 = − 64
3( − 8x − y + 3z) = (23)3
Multiply the second equation by 3
− 24x − 3y + 9z = 69

Add these two equations together

World View Note: Around 250, The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art
were published in China. This book had 246 problems, and chapter 8 was about
solving systems of equations. One problem had four equations with ﬁve variables!
Just as with two variables and two equations, we can have special cases come up
with three variables and three equations. The way we interpret the result is iden-
tical.
Example 184.
5x − 4y + 3z = − 4
− 10x + 8y − 6z = 8
We will eliminate x, start with ﬁrst two equations

15x − 12y + 9z = − 12

LCM of 5 and − 10 is 10.

Our Solution
Equations with three (or more) variables are not any more diﬃcult than two vari-
ables if we are careful to keep our information organized and eliminate the same
variable twice using two diﬀerent pairs of equations. It is possible to solve each
system several diﬀerent ways. We can use diﬀerent pairs of equations or eliminate
variables in diﬀerent orders, but as long as our information is organized and our
algebra is correct, we will arrive at the same ﬁnal solution.

Systems of Equations - Value Problems
Objective: Solve value problems by setting up a system of equations.
One application of system of equations are known as value problems. Value prob-
lems are ones where each variable has a value attached to it. For example, if our
variable is the number of nickles in a person’s pocket, those nickles would have a
value of ﬁve cents each. We will use a table to help us set up and solve value
problems. The basic structure of the table is shown below.
Number Value Total
Item 1
Item 2
Total
The ﬁrst column in the table is used for the number of things we have. Quite
often, this will be our variables. The second column is used for the that value
each item has. The third column is used for the total value which we calculate by
multiplying the number by the value. For example, if we have 7 dimes, each with
a value of 10 cents, the total value is 7 · 10 = 70 cents. The last row of the table is
for totals. We only will use the third row (also marked total) for the totals that
158
are given to use. This means sometimes this row may have some blanks in it.
Once the table is ﬁlled in we can easily make equations by adding each column,
setting it equal to the total at the bottom of the column. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example.
Example 186.
In a child’s bank are 11 coins that have a value of S1.85. The coins are either
quarters or dimes. How many coins each does child have?
Number Value Total

Using value table, use q for quarters, d for dimes
Each quarter′s value is 25 cents, dime′s is 10 cents

185
We have 11 coins total. This is the number total.
We have 1.85 for the ﬁnal total,
Write ﬁnal total in cents (185)
Because 25 and 10 are cents
q + d = 11
Firstandlastcolumnsareourequationsbyadding
25q + 10d = 185
Solve by either addition or substitution.
− 10(q + d) = (11)( − 10)
Using addition, multiply ﬁrst equation by − 10
− 10q − 10d = − 110
− 10q − 10d = − 110
Add together equations
25q + 10d = 185
15q
= 75
Divide both sides by 15
15
15
q = 5
We have our q, number of quarters is 5
(5) + d = 11
Plug into one of original equations
− 5
− 5
Subtract 5 from both sides
d = 6
We have our d, number of dimes is 6
159
5 quarters and 6 dimes
Our Solution
World View Note: American coins are the only coins that do not state the
value of the coin. On the back of the dime it says “one dime” (not 10 cents). On
the back of the quarter it says “one quarter” (not 25 cents). On the penny it
says “one cent” (not 1 cent). The rest of the world (Euros, Yen, Pesos, etc) all
write the value as a number so people who don’t speak the language can easily
use the coins.
Ticket sales also have a value. Often diﬀerent types of tickets sell for diﬀerent
prices (values). These problems can be solve in much the same way.
Example 187.
There were 41 tickets sold for an event. Tickets for children cost S1.50 and tickets
for adults cost S2.00. Total receipts for the event were S73.50. How many of each
type of ticket were sold?
Number Value Total

73.5
We have 41 tickets sold. This is our number total
The ﬁnal total was 73.50
Write in dollars as 1.5 and 2 are also dollars
c + a = 41
Firstandlastcolumnsareourequationsbyadding
1.5c + 2a = 73.5
We can solve by either addition or substitution
c + a = 41
We will solve by substitution.
− c
− c
Solve for a by subtracting c
a = 41 − c
1.5c + 2(41 − c) = 73.5
Substitute into untouched equation
1.5c + 82 − 2c = 73.5
Distribute
− 0.5c + 82 = 73.5
Combine like terms
− 82 − 82
Subtract 82 from both sides
− 0.5c = − 8.5
Divide both sides by − 0.5
160
− 0.5
− 0.5
c = 17
We have c, number of child tickets is 17
a = 41 − (17)
Plug into a = equation to ﬁnd a
a = 24
We have our a, number of adult tickets is 24
17 child tickets and 24 adult tickets
Our Solution
Some problems will not give us the total number of items we have. Instead they
will give a relationship between the items. Here we will have statements such
as “There are twice as many dimes as nickles”. While it is clear that we need to
multiply one variable by 2, it may not be clear which variable gets multiplied by
2. Generally the equations are backwards from the English sentence. If there are
twice as many dimes, than we multiply the other variable (nickels) by two. So the
equation would be d = 2n. This type of problem is in the next example.
Example 188.
A man has a collection of stamps made up of 5 cent stamps and 8 cent stamps.
There are three times as many 8 cent stamps as 5 cent stamps. The total value of
all the stamps is S3.48. How many of each stamp does he have?

Total column gives second equation
5f + 8(3f) = 348

Multiply ﬁrst
29f = 348
Combine like terms

Divide both sides by 39
f = 12
We have f. There are 12 ﬁve cent stamps
e = 3(12)
Plug into ﬁrst equation
161
e = 36
We have e, There are 36 eight cent stamps
12 ﬁve cent, 36 eight cent stamps
Our Solution
The same process for solving value problems can be applied to solving interest
problems. Our table titles will be adjusted slightly as we do so.
Invest Rate Interest
Account 1
Account 2
Total
Our ﬁrst column is for the amount invested in each account. The second column
is the interest rate earned (written as a decimal - move decimal point twice left),
and the last column is for the amount of interset earned. Just as before, we mul-
tiply the investment amount by the rate to ﬁnd the ﬁnal column, the interest
earned. This is shown in the following example.
Example 189.
A woman invests S4000 in two accounts, one at 6% interest, the other at 9%
interest for one year. At the end of the year she had earned S270 in interest. How
much did she have invested in each account?

Total investment is 4000,
Total interest was 276
x + y = 4000
First and last column give our two equations
0.06x + 0.09y = 270
Solve by either substitution or addition
− 0.06(x + y) = (4000)( − 0.06)
Use Addition, multiply ﬁrst equation by − 0.06
− 0.06x − 0.06y = − 240
162
− 0.06x − 0.06y = − 240
Add equations together
0.06x + 0.09y = 270
0.03y = 30
Divide both sides by 0.03
0.03 0.03
y = 1000
We have y, S1000 invested at 9%
x + 1000 = 4000
Plug into original equation
− 1000 − 1000
Subtract 1000 from both sides
x = 3000
We have x, S3000 invested at 6%
S1000 at 9% and S3000 at 6%
Our Solution
The same process can be used to ﬁnd an unknown interest rate.
Example 190.

Combine like terms

Subtract 320 from both sides

Divide both sides by 13000

We have our x, 7% interest

Systems of Equations - Mixture Problems
Objective: Solve mixture problems by setting up a system of equations.
One application of systems of equations are mixture problems. Mixture problems
are ones where two diﬀerent solutions are mixed together resulting in a new ﬁnal
solution. We will use the following table to help us solve mixture problems:
Amount Part Total
Item 1
Item 2
Final
The ﬁrst column is for the amount of each item we have. The second column is
labeled “part”. If we mix percentages we will put the rate (written as a decimal)
in this column. If we mix prices we will put prices in this column. Then we can
multiply the amount by the part to ﬁnd the total. Then we can get an equation
by adding the amount and/or total columns that will help us solve the problem
and answer the questions.
These problems can have either one or two variables. We will start with one vari-
able problems.
Example 191.
A chemist has 70 mL of a 50% methane solution. How much of a 80% solution
must she add so the ﬁnal solution is 60% methane?

Final
Set up the mixture table. We start with 70, but
don′t know how much we add, that is x. The part
is the percentages, 0.5 for start, 0.8 for add.

Final
70 + x

Add amount column to get ﬁnal amount. The
part for this amount is 0.6 because we want the
ﬁnal solution to be 60% methane.

42 + 0.6x
Multiply amount by part to get total.
be sure to distribute on the last row: (70 + x)0.6
35 + 0.8x = 42 + 0.6x
The last column is our equation by adding
− 0.6x
− 0.6x
Move variables to one side, subtract 0.6x
35 + 0.2x = 42
Subtract 35 from both sides
− 35
− 35
0.2x = 7
Divide both sides by 0.2
0.2 0.2
x = 35
We have our x!
35 mL must be added
Our Solution
The same process can be used if the starting and ﬁnal amount have a price
attached to them, rather than a percentage.
Example 192.
A coﬀee mix is to be made that sells for S2.50 by mixing two types of coﬀee. The
cafe has 40 mL of coﬀee that costs S3.00. How much of another coﬀee that costs
S1.50 should the cafe mix with the ﬁrst?

Move variables to one side by subtracting 1.5x
120 = 100 + x
Subtract 100 from both sides
− 100 − 100
20 = x
We have our x.
20mL must be added.
Our Solution
World View Note: Brazil is the world’s largest coﬀee producer, producing 2.59
million metric tons of coﬀee a year! That is over three times as much coﬀee as
second place Vietnam!
The above problems illustrate how we can put the mixture table together and get
an equation to solve. However, here we are interested in systems of equations,
with two unknown values. The following example is one such problem.
Example 193.
A farmer has two types of milk, one that is 24% butterfat and another which is
18% butterfat. How much of each should he use to end up with 42 gallons of 20%
butterfat?

Final

Multiply amount by part to get totals.
x + y = 42
The amount column gives one equation
0.24x + 0.18y = 8.4
The total column gives a second equation.
169
− 0.18(x + y) = (42)( − 0.18)
Use addition. Multiply ﬁrst equation by − 0.18
− 0.18x − 0.18y = − 7.56
− 0.18x − 0.18y = − 7.56
Add the equations together
0.24x + 0.18y = 8.4
0.06x
= 0.84
Divide both sides by 0.06
0.06
0.06
x = 14
We have our x, 14 gal of 24% butterfat
(14) + y = 42
Plug into original equation to ﬁnd y
− 14
− 14
Subtract 14 from both sides
y = 28
We have our y, 28 gal of 18% butterfat
14 gal of 24% and 28 gal of 18%
Our Solution
The same process can be used to solve mixtures of prices with two unknowns.
Example 194.
In a candy shop, chocolate which sells for S4 a pound is mixed with nuts which
are sold for S2.50 a pound are mixed to form a chocolate-nut candy which sells
for S3.50 a pound. How much of each are used to make 30 pounds of the mix-
ture?

Multiply amount by part to get totals
c + n = 30
First equation comes from the ﬁrst column
4c + 2.5n = 105
Second equation comes from the total column
c + n = 30
We will solve this problem with substitution
− n − n
Solveforcbysubtractingnfromtheﬁrstequation
c = 30 − n
170
4(30 − n) + 2.5n = 105
Substitute into untouched equation
120 − 4n + 2.5n = 105
Distribute
120 − 1.5n = 105
Combine like terms
− 120
− 120
Subtract 120 from both sides
− 1.5n = − 15
Divide both sides by − 1.5
− 1.5
− 1.5
n = 10
We have our n, 10 lbs of nuts
c = 30 − (10)
Plug into c = equation to ﬁnd c
c = 20
We have our c, 20 lbs of chocolate
10 lbs of nuts and 20 lbs of chocolate
Our Solution
With mixture problems we often are mixing with a pure solution or using water
which contains none of our chemical we are interested in. For pure solutions, the
percentage is 100% (or 1 in the table). For water, the percentage is 0%. This is
shown in the following example.
Example 195.
A solution of pure antifreeze is mixed with water to make a 65% antifreeze solu-
tion. How much of each should be used to make 70 L?

Second equation comes from second column
(45.5) + w = 70
We have a, plug into to other equation
− 45.5

Subtract 45.5 from both sides
w = 24.5
We have our w

Polynomials - Exponent Properties
Objective: Simplify expressions using the properties of exponents.
Problems with expoenents can often be simpliﬁed using a few basic exponent
properties. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. We will use this fact to
discover the important properties.
World View Note: The word exponent comes from the Latin “expo” meaning
out of and “ponere” meaning place. While there is some debate, it seems that the
Babylonians living in Iraq were the ﬁrst to do work with exponents (dating back
to the 23rd century BC or earlier!)
Example 196.
a3a2
Expand exponents to multiplication problem
(aaa)(aa)
Now we have 5a′s being multiplied together
a5
Our Solution
A quicker method to arrive at our answer would have been to just add the expo-
nents: a3a2 = a3+2 = a5 This is known as the product rule of exponents
Product Rule of Exponents: aman = am+n
The product rule of exponents can be used to simplify many problems. We will
add the exponent on like variables. This is shown in the following examples
Example 197.
32 · 36 · 3
Same base, add the exponents 2 + 6 + 1
39
Our Solution
Example 198.
2x3y5z · 5xy2z3
Multiply 2 · 5, add exponents on x, y and z
10x4y7z4
Our Solution
Rather than multiplying, we will now try to divide with exponents
Example 199.
a5
a2
Expand exponents
aaaaa
aa
Divide out two of the a′s
aaa
Convert to exponents
a3
Our Solution
177
A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to just subtract the
exponents, a5
a2 = a5−2 = a3. This is known as the quotient rule of exponents.
Quotient Rule of Exponents: am
an = am−n
The quotient rule of exponents can similarly be used to simplify exponent prob-
lems by subtracting exponents on like variables. This is shown in the following
examples.
Example 200.
713
75
Same base, subtract the exponents
78
Our Solution
Example 201.
5a3b5c2
2ab3c
Subtract exponents on a, b and c
5
2a2b2c
Our Solution
A third property we will look at will have an exponent problem raised to a second
exponent. This is investigated in the following example.
Example 202.
�a2�3
This means we have a2 three times
a2 · a2 · a2
Add exponents
a6
Our solution
A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to just multiply the
exponents, (a2)3 = a2·3 = a6. This is known as the power of a power rule of expo-
nents.
Power of a Power Rule of Exponents: (am)n= amn
This property is often combined with two other properties which we will investi-
gate now.
Example 203.
(ab)3
This means we have (ab) three times
(ab)(ab)(ab)
Three a′s and three b′s can be written with exponents
a3b3
Our Solution
178
A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to take the exponent
of three and put it on each factor in parenthesis, (ab)3 = a3b3. This is known as
the power of a product rule or exponents.
Power of a Product Rule of Exponents: (ab)m= ambm
It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multipli-
cation inside parenthesis. This property does NOT work if there is addition or
subtraction.
Warning 204.
(a + b)m
� am + bm
These are NOT equal, beware of this error!
Another property that is very similar to the power of a product rule is considered
next.
Example 205.
� a
b
�3
This means we have the fraction three timse
� a
b
�� a
b
�� a
b
�
Multiply fractions across the top and bottom, using exponents
a3
b3
Our Solution
A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to put the exponent
on every factor in both the numerator and denominator, � a
b
�3 = a3
b3. This is known
as the power of a quotient rule of exponents.
Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents:
� a
b
�m
= am
bm
The power of a power, product and quotient rules are often used together to sim-
plify expressions. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 206.
(x3yz2)4
Put the exponent of 4 on each factor, multiplying powers
x12y4z8
Our solution
179
Example 207.
� a3b
c8d5
�2
Put the exponent of 2 on each factor, multiplying powers
a6b2
c8d10
Our Solution
As we multiply exponents its important to remember these properties apply to
exponents, not bases. An expressions such as 53 does not mean we multipy 5 by 3,
rather we multiply 5 three times, 5 × 5 × 5 = 125. This is shown in the next
example.
Example 208.
(4x2y5)3
Put the exponent of 3 on each factor, multiplying powers
43x6y15
Evaluate 43
64x6y15
Our Solution
In the previous example we did not put the 3 on the 4 and multipy to get 12, this
would have been incorrect. Never multipy a base by the exponent. These proper-
ties pertain to exponents only, not bases.
In this lesson we have discussed 5 diﬀerent exponent properties. These rules are
summarized in the following table.
Rules of Exponents
Product Rule of Exponents
aman = am+n
Quotient Rule of Exponents

an = am−n
Power of a Power Rule of Exponents
(am)n = amn
Power of a Product Rule of Exponents
(ab)m= ambm

bm
These ﬁve properties are often mixed up in the same problem. Often there is a bit
of ﬂexibility as to which property is used ﬁrst. However, order of operations still
applies to a problem. For this reason it is the suggestion of the auther to simplify
inside any parenthesis ﬁrst, then simplify any exponents (using power rules), and
ﬁnally simplify any multiplication or division (using product and quotient rules).
This is illustrated in the next few examples.
Example 209.
(4x3y · 5x4y2)3
In parenthesis simplify using product rule, adding exponents
(20x7y3)3
With power rules, put three on each factor, multiplying exponents
203x21y9
Evaluate 203
8000x21y9
Our Solution
180
Example 210.
7a3(2a4)3
Parenthesis are already simpliﬁed, next use power rules
7a3(8a12)
Using product rule, add exponents and multiply numbers
56a15
Our Solution
Example 211.
3a3b· 10a4b3
2a4b2
Simplify numerator with product rule, adding exponents
30a7b4
2a4b2
Now use the quotient rule to subtract exponents
15a3b2
Our Solution
Example 212.
3m8n12
(m2n3)3
Use power rule in denominator
3m8n12
m6n9
Use quotient rule

Our solution
Example 213.

Simplify inside parenthesis ﬁrst, using power rule in numerator
� 3ab2(8a12b6)
6a5b7
�2
Simplify numerator using product rule
� 24a13b8
6a5b7
�2
Simplify using the quotient rule
�4a8b)2
Now that the parenthesis are simpliﬁed, use the power rules
16a16b2
Our Solution
Clearly these problems can quickly become quite involved. Remember to follow
order of operations as a guide, simplify inside parenthesis ﬁrst, then power rules,
then product and quotient rules.

Polynomials - Negative Exponents
Objective: Simplify expressions with negative exponents using the
properties of exponents.
There are a few special exponent properties that deal with exponents that are not
positive. The ﬁrst is considered in the following example, which is worded out 2
diﬀerent ways:
Example 214.
a3
a3
Use the quotient rule to subtract exponents
a0
Our Solution, but now we consider the problem a the second way:
a3
a3
Rewrite exponents as repeated multiplication
aaa
aaa
Reduce out all the a′s
1
1 = 1
Our Solution, when we combine the two solutions we get:
a0 = 1
Our ﬁnal result.
This ﬁnal result is an imporant property known as the zero power rule of expo-
nents
Zero Power Rule of Exponents: a0 = 1
Any number or expression raised to the zero power will always be 1. This is illus-
trated in the following example.
Example 215.
(3x2)0
Zero power rule
1
Our Solution
Another property we will consider here deals with negative exponents. Again we
will solve the following example two ways.
183
Example 216.
a3
a5
Using the quotient rule, subtract exponents
a−2
Our Solution, but we will also solve this problem another way.
a3
a5
Rewrite exponents as repeated multiplication
aaa
aaaaa
Reduce three a′s out of top and bottom
1
aa
Simplify to exponents
1
a2
Our Solution, putting these solutions together gives:
a−2 = 1
a2
Our Final Solution
This example illustrates an important property of exponents. Negative exponents
yield the reciprocal of the base. Once we take the reciprical the exponent is now
positive. Also, it is important to note a negative exponent does not mean the
expression is negative, only that we need the reciprocal of the base. Following are
the rules of negative exponents
Rules of Negative Exponets:
a−m= 1
m
1
a−m = am
� a
b
�−m
= bm
am
Negative exponents can be combined in several diﬀerent ways. As a general rule if
we think of our expression as a fraction, negative exponents in the numerator
must be moved to the denominator, likewise, negative exponents in the denomi-
nator need to be moved to the numerator. When the base with exponent moves,
the exponent is now positive. This is illustrated in the following example.
Example 217.
a3b−2c
2d−1 e−4f 2
Negative exponents on b, d, and e need to ﬂip
a 3cde4
2b2f 2
Our Solution
184
As we simpliﬁed our fraction we took special care to move the bases that had a
negative exponent, but the expression itself did not become negative because of
those exponents. Also, it is important to remember that exponents only eﬀect
what they are attached to. The 2 in the denominator of the above example does
not have an exponent on it, so it does not move with the d.
We now have the following nine properties of exponents. It is important that we
are very familiar with all of them.
Properties of Exponents
aman = am+n
(ab)m= ambm
a−m= 1
am
am
an = am−n
� a
b
�m
= am
bm
1
a−m = am
(am)n = amn
a0 = 1
� a
b
�−m
= bm
am
World View Note: Nicolas Chuquet, the French mathematician of the 15th cen-
tury wrote 121m¯ to indicate 12x−1. This was the ﬁrst known use of the negative
exponent.
Simplifying with negative exponents is much the same as simplifying with positive
exponents. It is the advice of the author to keep the negative exponents until the
end of the problem and then move them around to their correct location (numer-
ator or denominator). As we do this it is important to be very careful of rules for
adding, subtracting, and multiplying with negatives. This is illustrated in the fol-
lowing examples
Example 218.
4x−5y−3 · 3x3y−2
6x−5y3
Simplify numerator with product rule, adding exponents
12x−2y−5
6x−5y3
Quotient rule to subtract exponets, be careful with negatives!
( − 2) − ( − 5) = ( − 2) + 5 = 3
( − 5) − 3 = ( − 5) + ( − 3) = − 8
2x3y−8
Negative exponent needs to move down to denominator
2x3
y8
Our Solution
185
Example 219.
(3ab3)−2ab−3
2a−4b0
In numerator, use power rule with − 2, multiplying exponents
In denominator, b0 = 1
3−2a−2b−6ab−3
2a−4
In numerator, use product rule to add exponents
3−2a−1b−9
2a−4
Use quotient rule to subtract exponents, be careful with negatives
( − 1) − ( − 4) = ( − 1) + 4 = 3
3−2a3b−9
2
Move 3 and b to denominator because of negative exponents
a3
322b9
Evaluate 322
a3
18b9
Our Solution
In the previous example it is important to point out that when we simpliﬁed 3−2
we moved the three to the denominator and the exponent became positive. We
did not make the number negative! Negative exponents never make the bases neg-
ative, they simply mean we have to take the reciprocal of the base. One ﬁnal
example with negative exponents is given here.
Example 220.
� 3x−2y5z3 · 6x−6y−2z−3
9(x2y−2)−3
�−3
In numerator, use product rule, adding exponents
In denominator, use power rule, multiplying exponets
� 18x−8y3z0
9x−6y6
�−3
Use quotient rule to subtract exponents,
be careful with negatives:
( − 8) − ( − 6) = ( − 8) + 6 = − 2
3 − 6 = 3 + ( − 6) = − 3
(2x−2y−3z0)−3
Parenthesis are done, use power rule with − 3
2−3x6y9z0
Move 2 with negative exponent down and z0 = 1

Polynomials - Scientiﬁc Notation
Objective: Multiply and divide expressions using scientiﬁc notation and
exponent properties.
One application of exponent properties comes from scientiﬁc notation. Scientiﬁc
notation is used to represent really large or really small numbers. An example of
really large numbers would be the distance that light travels in a year in miles.
An example of really small numbers would be the mass of a single hydrogen atom
in grams. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these
numbers would normally be very combersome. However, our exponent properties
make this process much simpler.
First we will take a look at what scientiﬁc notation is. Scientiﬁc notation has two
parts, a number between one and ten (it can be equal to one, but not ten), and
that number multiplied by ten to some exponent.
Scientiﬁc Notation: a × 10b where 1 ⩽ a < 10
The exponent, b, is very important to how we convert between scientiﬁc notation
and normal numbers, or standard notation. The exponent tells us how many
times we will multiply by 10. Multiplying by 10 in aﬀect moves the decimal point
one place. So the exponent will tell us how many times the exponent moves
between scientiﬁc notation and standard notation. To decide which direction to
move the decimal (left or right) we simply need to remember that positive expo-
nents mean in standard notation we have a big number (bigger than ten) and neg-
ative exponents mean in standard notation we have a small number (less than
one).
Keeping this in mind, we can easily make conversions between standard notation
and scientiﬁc notation.
Example 221.
Convert 14, 200 to scientiﬁc notation
Put decimal after ﬁrst nonzero number
1.42
Exponent is how many times decimal moved, 4
× 104
Positive exponent, standard notation is big
1.42 × 104
Our Solution
Example 222.
Convert 0.0042 to scientiﬁc notation
Put decimal after ﬁrst nonzero number
4.2
Exponent is how many times decimal moved, 3
× 10−3
Negative exponent, standard notation is small
4.2 × 10−3
Our Solution

Our Solution
Example 224.
Conver 7.4 × 10−3 to standard notation
Negativeexponentmeansstandardnotation
isasmallnumber.Movedecimalleft3places
0.0074
Our Solution
Converting between standard notation and scientiﬁc notation is important to
understand how scientiﬁc notation works and what it does. Here our main
interest is to be able to multiply and divide numbers in scientiﬁc notation using
exponent properties. The way we do this is ﬁrst do the operation with the front
number (multiply or divide) then use exponent properties to simplify the 10’s.
Scientiﬁc notation is the only time where it will be allowed to have negative expo-
nents in our ﬁnal solution. The negative exponent simply informs us that we are
dealing with small numbers. Consider the following examples.
Example 225.
(2.1 × 10−7)(3.7 × 105)
Deal with numbers and 10′s separately
(2.1)(3.7) = 7.77
Multiply numbers
10−7105 = 10−2
Use product rule on 10′s and add exponents
7.77 × 10−2
Our Solution
Example 226.
4.96 × 104
3.1 × 10−3
Deal with numbers and 10′s separately
4.96
3.1 = 1.6
Divide Numbers
104
10−3 = 107
Use quotient rule to subtract exponents, be careful with negatives!
Be careful with negatives, 4 − ( − 3) = 4 + 3 = 7
1.6 × 107
Our Solution
189
Example 227.
(1.8 × 10−4)3
Use power rule to deal with numbers and 10′s separately
1.83 = 5.832
Evaluate 1.83
(10−4)3 = 10−12
Multiply exponents
5.832 × 10−12
Our Solution
Often when we multiply or divide in scientiﬁc notation the end result is not in sci-
entiﬁc notation. We will then have to convert the front number into scientiﬁc
notation and then combine the 10’s using the product property of exponents and
adding the exponents. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 228.
(4.7 × 10−3)(6.1 × 109)
Deal with numbers and 10′s separately
(4.7)(6.1) = 28.67
Multiply numbers
2.867 × 101
Convert this number into scientiﬁc notation
10110−3109 = 107
Use product rule, add exponents, using 101 from conversion
2.867 × 107
Our Solution
World View Note: Archimedes (287 BC - 212 BC), the Greek mathematician,
developed a system for representing large numbers using a system very similar to
scientiﬁc notation. He used his system to calculate the number of grains of sand it
would take to ﬁll the universe. His conclusion was 1063 grains of sand because he
ﬁgured the universe to have a diameter of 1014 stadia or about 2 light years.
Example 229.
2.014 × 10−3
3.8 × 10−7
Deal with numbers and 10′s separately
2.014
3.8 = 0.53
Divide numbers
0.53 = 5.3 × 10−1
Change this number into scientiﬁc notation
10−110−3
10−7
= 103
Use product and quotient rule, using 10−1 from the conversion
Be careful with signs:
( − 1) + ( − 3) − ( − 7) = ( − 1) + ( − 3) + 7 = 3
5.3 × 103

Polynomials - Introduction to Polynomials
Objective: Evaluate, add, and subtract polynomials.
Many applications in mathematics have to do with what are called polynomials.
Polynomials are made up of terms. Terms are a product of numbers and/or vari-
ables. For example, 5x, 2y2, − 5, ab3c, and x are all terms. Terms are connected
to each other by addition or subtraction. Expressions are often named based on
the number of terms in them. A monomial has one term, such as 3x2. A bino-
mial has two terms, such as a2 − b2. A Trinomial has three terms, such as ax2 +
bx + c. The term polynomial means many terms. Monomials, binomials, trino-
mials, and expressions with more terms all fall under the umbrella of “polyno-
mials”.
If we know what the variable in a polynomial represents we can replace the vari-
able with the number and evaluate the polynomial as shown in the following
example.
Example 230.
2x2 − 4x + 6 when x = − 4
Replace variable x with − 4
2( − 4)2 − 4( − 4) + 6
Exponents ﬁrst
2(16) − 4( − 4) + 6
Multiplication (we can do all terms at once)
32 + 16 + 6
Add
54
Our Solution
It is important to be careful with negative variables and exponents. Remember
the exponent only eﬀects the number it is physically attached to. This means −
32 = − 9 because the exponent is only attached to the 3. Also, ( − 3)2 = 9 because
the exponent is attached to the parenthesis and eﬀects everything inside. When
we replace a variable with parenthesis like in the previous example, the substi-
tuted value is in parenthesis. So the ( − 4)2 = 16 in the example. However, con-
sider the next example.
Example 231.
− x2 + 2x + 6 when x = 3
Replace variable x with 3
− (3)2 + 2(3) + 6
Exponent only on the 3, not negative
− 9 + 2(3) + 6
Multiply
− 9 + 6 + 6
Add
3
Our Solution
192
World View Note: Ada Lovelace in 1842 described a Diﬀerence Engine that
would be used to caluclate values of polynomials. Her work became the founda-
tion for what would become the modern computer (the programming language
Ada was named in her honor), more than 100 years after her death from cancer.
Generally when working with polynomials we do not know the value of the vari-
able, so we will try and simplify instead. The simplest operation with polynomials
is addition. When adding polynomials we are mearly combining like terms. Con-
sider the following example
Example 232.
(4x3 − 2x + 8) + (3x3 − 9x2 − 11)
Combine like terms 4x3 + 3x3 and 8 − 11
7x3 − 9x2 − 2x − 3
Our Solution
Generally ﬁnal answers for polynomials are written so the exponent on the vari-
able counts down. Example 3 demonstrates this with the exponent counting down
3, 2, 1, 0 (recall x0 = 1). Subtracting polynomials is almost as fast. One extra step
comes from the minus in front of the parenthesis. When we have a negative in
front of parenthesis we distribute it through, changing the signs of everything
inside. The same is done for the subtraction sign.

Polynomials - Multiplying Polynomials
Objective: Multiply polynomials.
Multiplying polynomials can take several diﬀerent forms based on what we are
multiplying. We will ﬁrst look at multiplying monomials, then monomials by
polynomials and ﬁnish with polynomials by polynomials.
Multiplying monomials is done by multiplying the numbers or coeﬃcients and
then adding the exponents on like factors. This is shown in the next example.
Example 235.
(4x3y4z)(2x2y6z3)
Multiply numbers and add exponents for x, y, and z
8x5y10z4
Our Solution
In the previous example it is important to remember that the z has an exponent
of 1 when no exponent is written. Thus for our answer the z has an exponent of
1 + 3 = 4. Be very careful with exponents in polynomials. If we are adding or sub-
tracting the exponnets will stay the same, but when we multiply (or divide) the
exponents will be changing.
Next we consider multiplying a monomial by a polynomial. We have seen this
operation before with distributing through parenthesis. Here we will see the exact
same process.
Example 236.
4x3(5x2 − 2x + 5)
Distribute the 4x3, multiplying numbers, adding exponents
20x5 − 8x4 + 20x3
Our Solution
Following is another example with more variables. When distributing the expo-
nents on a are added and the exponents on b are added.
Example 237.
2a3b(3ab2 − 4a)
Distribute, multiplying numbers and adding exponents
6a4b3 − 8a4b
Our Solution
There are several diﬀerent methods for multiplying polynomials. All of which
work, often students prefer the method they are ﬁrst taught. Here three methods
will be discussed. All three methods will be used to solve the same two multipli-
cation problems.
Multiply by Distributing
196
Just as we distribute a monomial through parenthesis we can distribute an entire
polynomial. As we do this we take each term of the second polynomial and put it
in front of the ﬁrst polynomial.
Example 238.
(4x + 7y)(3x − 2y)
Distribute (4x + 7y) through parenthesis
3x(4x + 7y) − 2y(4x + 7y)
Distribute the 3x and − 2y
12x2 + 21xy − 8xy − 14y2
Combine like terms 21xy − 8xy
12x2 + 13xy − 14y2
Our Solution
This example illustrates an important point, the negative/subtraction sign stays
with the 2y. Which means on the second step the negative is also distributed
through the last set of parenthesis.
Multiplying by distributing can easily be extended to problems with more terms.
First distribute the front parenthesis onto each term, then distribute again!
Example 239.
(2x − 5)(4x2 − 7x + 3)
Distribute (2x − 5) through parenthesis
4x2(2x − 5) − 7x(2x − 5) + 3(2x − 5)
Distributeagainthrougheachparenthesis
8x3 − 20x2 − 14x2 + 35x + 6x − 15
Combine like terms
8x3 − 34x2 + 41x − 15
Our Solution
This process of multiplying by distributing can easily be reversed to do an impor-
tant procedure known as factoring. Factoring will be addressed in a future lesson.
Multiply by FOIL
Another form of multiplying is known as FOIL. Using the FOIL method we mul-
tiply each term in the ﬁrst binomial by each term in the second binomial. The
letters of FOIL help us remember every combination. F stands for First, we mul-
tiply the ﬁrst term of each binomial. O stand for Outside, we multiply the outside
two terms. I stands for Inside, we multiply the inside two terms. L stands for
Last, we multiply the last term of each binomial. This is shown in the next
example:
Example 240.
(4x + 7y)(3x − 2y)
Use FOIL to multiply
(4x)(3x) = 12x2
F − First terms (4x)(3x)
(4x)( − 2y) = − 8xy
O − Outside terms (4x)( − 2y)
(7y)(3x) = 21xy
I − Inside terms (7y)(3x)
(7y)( − 2y) = − 14y2
L − Last terms (7y)( − 2y)
12x2 − 8xy + 21xy − 14y2
Combine like terms − 8xy + 21xy
12x2 + 13xy − 14y2
Our Solution
197
Some students like to think of the FOIL method as distributing the ﬁrst term 4x
through the (3x − 2y) and distributing the second term 7y through the (3x − 2y).
Thinking about FOIL in this way makes it possible to extend this method to
problems with more terms.
Example 241.
(2x − 5)(4x2 − 7x + 3)
Distribute 2x and − 5
(2x)(4x2) + (2x)( − 7x) + (2x)(3) − 5(4x2) − 5( − 7x) − 5(3)
Multiply out each term
8x3 − 14x2 + 6x − 20x2 + 35x − 15
Combine like terms
8x3 − 34x2 + 41x − 15
Our Solution
The second step of the FOIL method is often not written, for example, consider
the previous example, a student will often go from the problem (4x + 7y)(3x − 2y)
and do the multiplication mentally to come up with 12x2 − 8xy + 21xy − 14y2 and
then combine like terms to come up with the ﬁnal solution.
Multiplying in rows
A third method for multiplying polynomials looks very similar to multiplying
numbers. Consider the problem:
35
× 27
245
Multiply 7 by 5 then 3
700
Use 0 for placeholder, multiply 2 by 5 then 3
945
Add to get Our Solution
World View Note: The ﬁrst known system that used place values comes from
Chinese mathematics, dating back to 190 AD or earlier.
The same process can be done with polynomials. Multiply each term on the
bottom with each term on the top.
Example 242.
(4x + 7y)(3x − 2y)
Rewrite as vertical problem
4x + 7y
× 3x − 2y
− 8xy − 14y2
Multiply − 2y by 7y then 4x
12x2 + 21xy
Multiply 3x by 7y then 4x. Line up like terms
12x2 + 13xy − 14y2
Add like terms to get Our Solution
This same process is easily expanded to a problem with more terms.
198
Example 243.
(2x − 5)(4x2 − 7x + 3)
Rewrite as vertical problem
4x3 − 7x + 3
Put polynomial with most terms on top
× 2x − 5
− 20x2 + 35x − 15
Multiply − 5 by each term
8x3 − 14x2 + 6x
Multiply 2x by each term. Line up like terms
8x3 − 34x2 + 41x − 15
Add like terms to get our solution
This method of multiplying in rows also works with multiplying a monomial by a
polynomial!
Any of the three described methods work to multiply polynomials. It is suggested
that you are very comfortable with at least one of these methods as you work
through the practice problems. All three methods are shown side by side in the
example.
Example 244.
(2x − y)(4x − 5y)
Distribute
FOIL
Rows
4x(2x − y) − 5y(2x − y)
2x(4x) + 2x( − 5y) − y(4x) − y( − 5y)
2x − y
8x2 − 4xy − 10xy − 5y2
8x2 − 10xy − 4xy + 5y2
× 4x − 5y
8x2 − 14xy − 5y2
8x2 − 14xy + 5y2
− 10xy + 5y2
8x2 − 4xy
8x2 − 14xy + 5y2
When we are multiplying a monomial by a polynomial by a polynomial we can
solve by ﬁrst multiplying the polynomials then distributing the coeﬃcient last.
This is shown in the last example.
Example 245.
3(2x − 4)(x + 5)
Multiply the binomials, we will use FOIL
3(2x2 + 10x − 4x − 20)
Combine like terms
3(2x2 + 6x − 20)
Distribute the 3
6x2 + 18x − 60
Our Solution
A common error students do is distribute the three at the start into both paren-
thesis. While we can distribute the 3 into the (2x − 4) factor, distributing into
both would be wrong. Be careful of this error. This is why it is suggested to mul-
tiply the binomials ﬁrst, then distribute the coeﬃenct last.

Polynomials - Multiply Special Products
Objective: Recognize and use special product rules of a sum and diﬀer-
ence and perfect squares to multiply polynomials.
There are a few shortcuts that we can take when multiplying polynomials. If we
can recognize them the shortcuts can help us arrive at the solution much quicker.
These shortcuts will also be useful to us as our study of algebra continues.
The ﬁrst shortcut is often called a sum and a diﬀerence. A sum and a diﬀer-
ence is easily recognized as the numbers and variables are exactly the same, but
the sign in the middle is diﬀerent (one sum, one diﬀerence). To illustrate the
shortcut consider the following example, multiplied by the distributing method.
Example 246.
(a + b)(a − b)
Distribute (a + b)
a(a + b) − b(a + b)
Distribute a and − b
a2 + ab − ab − b2
Combine like terms ab − ab
a2 − b2
Our Solution
The important part of this example is the middle terms subtracted to zero.
Rather than going through all this work, when we have a sum and a diﬀerence we
will jump right to our solution by squaring the ﬁrst term and squaring the last
term, putting a subtraction between them. This is illustrated in the following
example
Example 247.
(x − 5)(x + 5)
Recognize sum and diﬀerence
x2 − 25
Square both, put subtraction between. Our Solution
This is much quicker than going through the work of multiplying and combining
like terms. Often students ask if they can just multiply out using another method
and not learn the shortcut. These shortcuts are going to be very useful when we
get to factoring polynomials, or reversing the multiplication process. For this
reason it is very important to be able to recognize these shortcuts. More examples
are shown here.
201
Example 248.
(3x + 7)(3x − 7)
Recognize sum and diﬀerence
9x2 − 49
Square both, put subtraction between. Our Solution
Example 249.
(2x − 6y)(2x + 6y)
Recognize sum and diﬀerence
4x2 − 36y2
Square both, put subtraction between. Our Solution
It is interesting to note that while we can multiply and get an answer like a2 − b2
(with subtraction), it is impossible to multiply real numbers and end up with a
product such as a2 + b2 (with addition).
Another shortcut used to multiply is known as a perfect square. These are easy
to recognize as we will have a binomial with a 2 in the exponent. The following
example illustrates multiplying a perfect square
Example 250.
(a + b)2
Squared is same as multiplying by itself
(a + b)(a + b)
Distribute (a + b)
a(a + b) + b(a + b)
Distribute again through ﬁnal parenthesis
a2 + ab + ab + b2
Combine like terms ab + ab
a2 + 2ab + b2
Our Solution
This problem also helps us ﬁnd our shortcut for multiplying. The ﬁrst term in the
answer is the square of the ﬁrst term in the problem. The middle term is 2 times
the ﬁrst term times the second term. The last term is the square of the last term.
This can be shortened to square the ﬁrst, twice the product, square the last. If we
can remember this shortcut we can square any binomial. This is illustrated in the
following example
Example 251.
(x − 5)2
Recognize perfect square
x2
Square the ﬁrst
2(x)( − 5) = − 10x
Twice the product
( − 5)2 = 25
Square the last
x2 − 10x + 25
Our Solution
202
Be very careful when we are squaring a binomial to NOT distribute the square
through the parenthesis. A common error is to do the following: (x − 5)2 = x2 − 25
(or x2 + 25). Notice both of these are missing the middle term, − 10x. This is
why it is important to use the shortcut to help us ﬁnd the correct solution.
Another important observation is that the middle term in the solution always has
the same sign as the middle term in the problem. This is illustrated in the next
examples.
Example 252.
(2x + 5)2
Recognize perfect square
(2x)2 = 4x2
Square the ﬁrst
2(2x)(5) = 20x
Twice the product
52 = 25
Square the last
4x2 + 20x + 25
Our Solution
Example 253.
(3x − 7y)2
Recognize perfect square
9x2 − 42xy + 49y2
Square the ﬁrst, twice the product, square the last. Our Solution
Example 254.
(5a + 9b)2
Recognize perfect square
25a2 + 90ab + 81b2
Square the ﬁrst, twice the product, square the last. Our Solution
These two formulas will be important to commit to memory. The more familiar
we are with them, the easier factoring, or multiplying in reverse, will be. The ﬁnal
example covers both types of problems (two perfect squares, one positive, one
negative), be sure to notice the diﬀerence between the examples and how each for-
mula is used
Example 255.
(4x − 7)(4x + 7)
(4x + 7)2
(4x − 7)2
16x2 − 49
16x2 + 56x + 49
16x2 − 56x + 49
World View Note: There are also formulas for higher powers of binomials as
well, such as (a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3. While French mathematician Blaise
Pascal often gets credit for working with these expansions of binomials in the 17th
century, Chinese mathematicians had been working with them almost 400 years
earlier!

Polynomials - Divide Polynomials
Objective: Divide polynomials using long division.
Dividing polynomials is a process very similar to long division of whole numbers.
But before we look at that, we will ﬁrst want to be able to master dividing a
polynomial by a monomial. The way we do this is very similar to distributing,
but the operation we distribute is the division, dividing each term by the mono-
mial and reducing the resulting expression. This is shown in the following exam-
ples
Example 256.
9x5 + 6x4 − 18x3 − 24x2
3x2
Divide each term in the numerator by 3x2
9x5
3x2 + 6x4
3x2 − 18x3
3x2 − 24x2
3x2
Reduce each fraction, subtracting exponents
3x3 + 2x2 − 6x − 8
Our Solution
Example 257.
8x3 + 4x2 − 2x + 6
4x2
Divide each term in the numerator by 4x2
8x3
4x2 + 4x2
4x2 − 2x
4x2 + 6
4x2
Reduce each fraction, subtracting exponents
Remember negative exponents are moved to denominator
2x + 1 − 1
2x + 3
2x2
Our Solution
The previous example illustrates that sometimes we will have fractions in our
solution, as long as they are reduced this will be correct for our solution. Also
interesting in this problem is the second term
4x2
4x2 divided out completely.
Remember that this means the reduced answer is 1 not 0.
Long division is required when we divide by more than just a monomial. Long
division with polynomials works very similar to long division with whole numbers.
205
An example is given to review the (general) steps that are used with whole num-
bers that we will also use with polynomials
Example 258.

− 28

1573
4
Our Solution
This same process will be used to multiply polynomials. The only diﬀerence is we
will replace the word “number” with the word “term”

Step number 3 tends to be the one that students skip, not changing the signs of
the terms would be equivalent to adding instead of subtracting on long division
with whole numbers. Be sure not to miss this step! This process is illustrated in
the following two examples.

Our Solution
In both of the previous example the dividends had the exponents on our variable
counting down, no exponent skipped, third power, second power, ﬁrst power, zero
power (remember x0 = 1 so there is no variable on zero power). This is very
important in long division, the variables must count down and no exponent can
be skipped. If they don’t count down we must put them in order. If an exponent
is skipped we will have to add a term to the problem, with zero for its coeﬃcient.
This is demonstrated in the following example.
208
Example 261.

− 14x − 42
Change the signs and combine
0
No remainder
2x2 − 6x + 14
Our Solution
It is important to take a moment to check each problem to verify that the expo-
nents count down and no exponent is skipped. If so we will have to adjust the
problem. Also, this ﬁnal example illustrates, just as in regular long division,
sometimes we have no remainder in a problem.

19th century. In 1809 he was the ﬁrst to describe a process called synthetic divi-
sion which could also be used to divide polynomials.

Factoring - Greatest Common Factor
Objective: Find the greatest common factor of a polynomial and factor
it out of the expression.
The opposite of multiplying polynomials together is factoring polynomials. There
are many beniﬁts of a polynomial being factored. We use factored polynomials to
help us solve equations, learn behaviors of graphs, work with fractions and more.
Because so many concepts in algebra depend on us being able to factor polyno-
mials it is very important to have very strong factoring skills.
In this lesson we will focus on factoring using the greatest common factor or GCF
of a polynomial. When we multiplied polynomials, we multiplied monomials by
polynomials by distributing, solving problems such as 4x2(2x2 − 3x + 8) = 8x4 −
12x3 + 32x. In this lesson we will work the same problem backwards. We will
start with 8x2 − 12x3 + 32x and try and work backwards to the 4x2(2x − 3x + 8).
To do this we have to be able to ﬁrst identify what is the GCF of a polynomial.
We will ﬁrst introduce this by looking at ﬁnding the GCF of several numbers. To
ﬁnd a GCF of sevearal numbers we are looking for the largest number that can be
divided by each of the numbers. This can often be done with quick mental math
and it is shown in the following example
Example 262.
Find the GCF of 15, 24, and 27
15
3 = 5, 24
3 = 6, 27
3 = 9
Each of the numbers can be divided by 3
GCF = 3
Our Solution
When there are variables in our problem we can ﬁrst ﬁnd the GCF of the num-
212
bers using mental math, then we take any variables that are in common with each
term, using the lowest exponent. This is shown in the next example
Example 263.
GCF of 24x4y2z, 18x2y4, and 12x3yz5
24
6 = 4, 18
6 = 3, 12
6 = 2
Each number can be divided by 6
x2y
x and y are in all 3, using lowest exponets
GCF = 6x2y
Our Solution
To factor out a GCF from a polynomial we ﬁrst need to identify the GCF of all
the terms, this is the part that goes in front of the parenthesis, then we divide
each term by the GCF, the answer is what is left inside the parenthesis. This is
shown in the following examples
Example 264.
4x2 − 20x + 16
GCF is 4, divide each term by 4
4x2
4 = x2, − 20x
4
= − 5x, 16
4 = 4
This is what is left inside the parenthesis
4(x2 − 5x + 4)
Our Solution
With factoring we can always check our solutions by multiplying (distributing in
this case) out the answer and the solution should be the original equation.
Example 265.
25x4 − 15x3 + 20x2
GCF is 5x2, divide each term by this
25x4
5x2 = 5x2, − 15x3
5x2
= − 3x, 20x2
5x2 = 4
This is what is left inside the parenthesis
5x2(5x2 − 3x + 4)
Our Solution
Example 266.
3x3y2z + 5x4y3z5 − 4xy4
GCF is xy2, divide each term by this
213
3x3y2z
xy2
= 3x2z, 5x4y3z5
xy2
= 5x3yz5, − 4xy4
xy2
= − 4y2
This is what is left in parenthesis
xy2(3x2z + 5x3yz5 − 4y2)
Our Solution
World
View
Note: The ﬁrst recorded algorithm for ﬁnding the greatest
common factor comes from Greek mathematician Euclid around the year 300 BC!
Example 267.
21x3 + 14x2 + 7x
GCF is 7x, divide each term by this
21x3
7x = 3x2, 14x2
7x = 2x, 7x
7x = 1
This is what is left inside the parenthesis
7x(3x2 + 2x + 1)
Our Solution
It is important to note in the previous example, that when the GCF was 7x and
7x was one of the terms, dividing gave an answer of 1. Students often try to
factor out the 7x and get zero which is incorrect, factoring will never make terms
dissapear. Anything divided by itself is 1, be sure to not forget to put the 1 into
the solution.
Often the second line is not shown in the work of factoring the GCF. We can
simply identify the GCF and put it in front of the parenthesis as shown in the fol-
lowing two examples.
Example 268.
12x5y2 − 6x4y4 + 8x3y5
GCF is 2x3y2, put this in front of parenthesis and divide
2x3y2(6x2 − 3xy2 + 4y3)
Our Solution
Example 269.
18a4 b3 − 27a3b3 + 9a2b3
GCF is 9a2b3, divide each term by this
9a2b3(2a2 − 3a + 1)
Our Solution
Again, in the previous problem, when dividing 9a2b3 by itself, the answer is 1, not
zero. Be very careful that each term is accounted for in your ﬁnal solution.

6.2
Factoring - Grouping
Objective: Factor polynomials with four terms using grouping.
The ﬁrst thing we will always do when factoring is try to factor out a GCF. This
GCF is often a monomial like in the problem 5xy + 10xz the GCF is the mono-
mial 5x, so we would have 5x(y + 2z). However, a GCF does not have to be a
monomial, it could be a binomial. To see this, consider the following two example.
Example 270.
3ax − 7bx
Both have x in common, factor it out
x(3a − 7b)
Our Solution
Now the same problem, but instead of x we have (2a + 5b).
Example 271.
3a(2a + 5b) − 7b(2a + 5b)
Both have (2a + 5b) in common, factor it out
(2a + 5b)(3a − 7b)
Our Solution
In the same way we factored out a GCF of x we can factor out a GCF which is a
binomial, (2a + 5b). This process can be extended to factor problems where there
is no GCF to factor out, or after the GCF is factored out, there is more factoring
that can be done. Here we will have to use another strategy to factor. We will use
a process known as grouping. Grouping is how we will factor if there are four
terms in the problem. Remember, factoring is like multiplying in reverse, so ﬁrst
we will look at a multiplication problem and then try to reverse the process.
Example 272.
(2a + 3)(5b + 2)
Distribute (2a + 3) into second parenthesis
5b(2a + 3) + 2(2a + 3)
Distribute each monomial
10ab + 15b + 4a + 6
Our Solution
The solution has four terms in it. We arrived at the solution by looking at the
two parts, 5b(2a + 3) and 2(2a + 3). When we are factoring by grouping we will
always divide the problem into two parts, the ﬁrst two terms and the last two
terms. Then we can factor the GCF out of both the left and right sides. When we
do this our hope is what is left in the parenthesis will match on both the left and
right. If they match we can pull this matching GCF out front, putting the rest in
parenthesis and we will be factored. The next example is the same problem
worked backwards, factoring instead of multiplying.
216
Example 273.
10ab + 15b + 4a + 6
Split problem into two groups
10ab + 15b + 4a + 6
GCF on left is 5b, on the right is 2
5b(2a + 3) + 2(2a + 3)
(2a + 3) is the same! Factor out this GCF
(2a + 3)(5b + 2)
Our Solution
The key for grouping to work is after the GCF is factored out of the left and
right, the two binomials must match exactly. If there is any diﬀerence between
the two we either have to do some adjusting or it can’t be factored using the
grouping method. Consider the following example.
Example 274.
6x2 + 9xy − 14x − 21y
Split problem into two groups
6x2 + 9xy − 14x − 21y
GCF on left is 3x, on right is 7
3x(2x + 3y) + 7( − 2x − 3y)
The signs in the parenthesis don′t match!
when the signs don’t match on both terms we can easily make them match by fac-
toring the opposite of the GCF on the right side. Instead of 7 we will use − 7.
This will change the signs inside the second parenthesis.
3x(2x + 3y) − 7(2x + 3y)
(2x + 3y) is the same! Factor out this GCF
(2x + 3y)(3x − 7)
Our Solution
Often we can recognize early that we need to use the opposite of the GCF when
factoring. If the ﬁrst term of the ﬁrst binomial is positive in the problem, we will
also want the ﬁrst term of the second binomial to be positive. If it is negative
then we will use the opposite of the GCF to be sure they match.
Example 275.
5xy − 8x − 10y + 16
Split the problem into two groups
5xy − 8x − 10y + 16
GCF on left is x, on right we need a negative,
so we use − 2
x(5y − 8) − 2(5y − 8)
(5y − 8) is the same! Factor out this GCF
(5y − 8)(x − 2)
Our Solution
217
Sometimes when factoring the GCF out of the left or right side there is no GCF
to factor out. In this case we will use either the GCF of 1 or − 1. Often this is all
we need to be sure the two binomials match.
Example 276.
12ab − 14a − 6b + 7
Split the problem into two groups
12ab − 14a − 6b + 7
GCF on left is 2a, on right, no GCF, use − 1
2a(6b − 7) − 1(6b − 7)
(6b − 7) is the same! Factor out this GCF
(6b − 7)(2a − 1)
Our Solution
Example 277.
6x3 − 15x2 + 2x − 5
Split problem into two groups
6x3 − 15x2 + 2x − 5
GCF on left is 3x2, on right, no GCF, use 1
3x2(2x − 5) + 1(2x − 5)
(2x − 5) is the same! Factor out this GCF
(2x − 5)(3x2 + 1)
Our Solution
Another problem that may come up with grouping is after factoring out the GCF
on the left and right, the binomials don’t match, more than just the signs are dif-
ferent. In this case we may have to adjust the problem slightly. One way to do
this is to change the order of the terms and try again. To do this we will move
the second term to the end of the problem and see if that helps us use grouping.
Example 278.
4a2 − 21b3 + 6ab − 14ab2
Split the problem into two groups
4a2 − 21b3 + 6ab − 14ab2
GCF on left is 1, on right is 2ab
1(4a2 − 21b3) + 2ab(3 − 7b)
Binomials don′t match! Move second term to end
4a2 + 6ab − 14ab2 − 21b3
Start over, split the problem into two groups
4a2 + 6ab − 14ab2 − 21b3
GCF on left is 2a, on right is − 7b2
2a(2a + 3b) − 7b2(2a + 3b)
(2a + 3b) is the same! Factor out this GCF
(2a + 3b)(2a − 7b2)
Our Solution
When rearranging terms the problem can still be out of order. Sometimes after
factoring out the GCF the terms are backwards. There are two ways that this can
happen, one with addition, one with subtraction. If it happens with addition, for
218
example the binomials are (a + b) and (b + a), we don’t have to do any extra
work. This is because addition is the same in either order (5 + 3 = 3 + 5 = 8).
Example 279.
7 + y − 3xy − 21x
Split the problem into two groups
7 + y − 3xy − 21x
GCF on left is 1, on the right is − 3x
1(7 + y) − 3x(y + 7)
y + 7 and 7 + y are the same, use either one
(y + 7)(1 − 3x)
Our Solution
However, if the binomial has subtraction, then we need to be a bit more careful.
For example, if the binomials are (a − b) and (b − a), we will factor out the oppo-
site of the GCF on one part, usually the second. Notice what happens when we
factor out − 1.
Example 280.
(b − a)
Factor out − 1
− 1( − b + a)
Addition can be in either order, switch order
− 1(a − b)
The order of the subtraction has been switched!
Generally we won’t show all the above steps, we will simply factor out the oppo-
site of the GCF and switch the order of the subtraction to make it match the
other binomial.
Example 281.
8xy − 12y + 15 − 10x
Split the problem into two groups
8xy − 12y 15 − 10x
GCF on left is 4y, on right, 5
4y(2x − 3) + 5(3 − 2x)
Need to switch subtraction order, use − 5 in middle
4y(2y − 3) − 5(2x − 3)
Now 2x − 3 match on both! Factor out this GCF
(2x − 3)(4y − 5)

Factoring - Trinomials where a = 1
Objective: Factor trinomials where the coeﬃcient of x2 is one.
Factoring with three terms, or trinomials, is the most important type of factoring
to be able to master. As factoring is multiplication backwards we will start with a
multipication problem and look at how we can reverse the process.
Example 282.
(x + 6)(x − 4)
Distribute (x + 6) through second parenthesis
x(x + 6) − 4(x + 6)
Distribute each monomial through parenthesis
x2 + 6x − 4x − 24
Combine like terms
x2 + 2x − 24
Our Solution
You may notice that if you reverse the last three steps the process looks like
grouping. This is because it is grouping! The GCF of the left two terms is x and
the GCF of the second two terms is − 4. The way we will factor trinomials is to
make them into a polynomial with four terms and then factor by grouping. This
is shown in the following example, the same problem worked backwards
Example 283.
x2 + 2x − 24
Split middle term into + 6x − 4x
x2 + 6x − 4x − 24
Grouping: GCF on left is x, on right is − 4
x(x + 6) − 4(x + 6)
(x + 6) is the same, factor out this GCF
(x + 6)(x − 4)
Our Solution
The trick to make these problems work is how we split the middle term. Why did
we pick + 6x − 4x and not + 5x − 3x? The reason is because 6x − 4x is the only
combination that works! So how do we know what is the one combination that
works? To ﬁnd the correct way to split the middle term we will use what is called
the ac method. In the next lesson we will discuss why it is called the ac method.
The way the ac method works is we ﬁnd a pair of numers that multiply to a cer-
tain number and add to another number. Here we will try to multiply to get the
last term and add to get the coeﬃcient of the middle term. In the previous
221
example that would mean we wanted to multiply to − 24 and add to + 2. The
only numbers that can do this are 6 and − 4 (6 · − 4 = − 24 and 6 + ( − 4) = 2).
This process is shown in the next few examples
Example 284.
x2 + 9x + 18
Want to multiply to 18, add to 9
x2 + 6x + 3x + 18
6 and 3, split the middle term
x(x + 6) + 3(x + 6)
Factor by grouping
(x + 6)(x + 3)
Our Solution
Example 285.
x2 − 4x + 3
Want to multiply to 3, add to − 4
x2 − 3x − x + 3
− 3 and − 1, split the middle term
x(x − 3) − 1(x − 3)
Factor by grouping
(x − 3)(x − 1)
Our Solution
Example 286.
x2 − 8x − 20
Want to multiply to − 20, add to − 8
x2 − 10x + 2x − 20
− 10 and 2, split the middle term
x(x − 10) + 2(x − 10)
Factor by grouping
(x − 10)(x + 2)
Our Solution
Often when factoring we have two variables. These problems solve just like prob-
lems with one variable, using the coeﬃcients to decide how to split the middle
term
Example 287.
a2 − 9ab + 14b2
Want to multiply to 14, add to − 9
a2 − 7ab − 2ab + 14b2
− 7 and − 2, split the middle term
a(a − 7b) − 2b(a − 7b)
Factor by grouping
(a − 7b)(a − 2b)
Our Solution
222
As the past few examples illustrate, it is very important to be aware of negatives
as we ﬁnd the pair of numbers we will use to split the middle term. Consier the
following example, done incorrectly, ignoring negative signs
Warning 288.
x2 + 5x − 6
Want to multiply to 6, add 5
x2 + 2x + 3x − 6
2 and 3, split the middle term
x(x + 2) + 3(x − 2)
Factor by grouping
???
Binomials do not match!
Because we did not use the negative sign with the six to ﬁnd our pair of numbers,
the binomials did not match and grouping was not able to work at the end. Now
the problem will be done correctly.
Example 289.
x2 + 5x − 6
Want to multiply to − 6, add to 5
x2 + 6x − x − 6
6 and − 1, split the middle term
x(x + 6) − 1(x + 6)
Factor by grouping
(x + 6)(x − 1)
Our Solution
You may have noticed a shortcut for factoring these problems. Once we identify
the two numbers that are used to split the middle term, these are the two num-
bers in our factors! In the previous example, the numbers used to split the middle
term were 6 and − 1, our factors turned out to be (x + 6)(x − 1). This pattern
does not always work, so be careful getting in the habit of using it. We can use it
however, when we have no number (technically we have a 1) in front of x2. In all
the problems we have factored in this lesson there is no number in front of x2. If
this is the case then we can use this shortcut. This is shown in the next few
examples.
Example 290.
x2 − 7x − 18
Want to multiply to − 18, add to − 7
− 9 and 2, write the factors
(x − 9)(x + 2)
Our Solution
223
Example 291.
m2 − mn − 30n2
Want to multiply to − 30, add to − 1
5 and − 6, write the factors, don′t forget second variable
(m + 5n)(m − 6n)
Our Solution
It is possible to have a problem that does not factor. If there is no combination of
numbers that multiplies and adds to the correct numbers, then we say we cannot
factor the polynomial, or we say the polynomial is prime. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example.
Example 292.
x2 + 2x + 6
Want to multiply to 6, add to 2
1 · 6 and 2 · 3
Only possibilities to multiply to six, none add to 2
Prime, can′t factor
Our Solution
When factoring it is important not to forget about the GCF. If all the terms in a
problem have a common factor we will want to ﬁrst factor out the GCF before we
factor using any other method.
Example 293.
3x2 − 24x + 45
GCF of all terms is 3, factor this out
3(x2 − 8x + 15)
Want to multiply to 15, add to − 8
− 5 and − 3, write the factors
3(x − 5)(x − 3)
Our Solution
Again it is important to comment on the shortcut of jumping right to the factors,
this only works if there is no coeﬃcient on x2. In the next lesson we will look at
how this process changes slightly when we have a number in front of x2. Be
careful not to use this shortcut on all factoring problems!
World View Note: The ﬁrst person to use letters for unknown values was Fran-
cois Vieta in 1591 in France. He used vowels to represent variables we are solving
for, just as codes used letters to represent an unknown message.

Factoring - Trinomials where a
� 1
Objective: Factor trinomials using the ac method when the coeﬃcient
of x2 is not one.
When factoring trinomials we used the ac method to split the middle term and
then factor by grouping. The ac method gets it’s name from the general trinomial
equation, ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are the numbers in front of x2,
x and the constant at the end respectively.
World View Note: It was French philosopher Rene Descartes who ﬁrst used let-
ters from the beginning of the alphabet to represent values we know (a, b, c) and
letters from the end to represent letters we don’t know and are solving for (x, y,
z).
The ac method is named ac because we multiply a · c to ﬁnd out what we want to
multiply to. In the previous lesson we always multiplied to just c because there
was no number in front of x2. This meant the number was 1 and we were multi-
plying to 1c or just c. Now we will have a number in front of x2 so we will be
looking for numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. Other than this, the pro-
cess will be the same.
Example 294.
3x2 + 11x + 6
Multiply to ac or (3)(6) = 18, add to 11
3x2 + 9x + 2x + 6
The numbers are 9 and 2, split the middle term
3x(x + 3) + 2(x + 3)
Factor by grouping
(x + 3)(3x + 2)
Our Solution
When a = 1, or no coeﬃcient in front of x2, we were able to use a shortcut, using
the numbers that split the middle term in the factors. The previous example illus-
trates an important point, the shortcut does not work when a
� 1. We must go
through all the steps of grouping in order to factor the problem.
Example 295.
8x2 − 2x − 15
Multiply to ac or (8)( − 15) = − 120, add to − 2
8x2 − 12x + 10x − 15
The numbers are − 12 and 10, split the middle term
4x(2x − 3) + 5(2x − 3)
Factor by grouping
(2x − 3)(4x + 5)
Our Solution
226
Example 296.
10x2 − 27x + 5
Multiply to ac or (10)(5) = 50, add to − 27
10x2 − 25x − 2x + 5
The numbers are − 25 and − 2, split the middle term
5x(2x − 5) − 1(2x − 5)
Factor by grouping
(2x − 5)(5x − 1)
Our Solution
The same process works with two variables in the problem
Example 297.
4x2 − xy − 5y2
Multiply to ac or (4)( − 5) = − 20, add to − 1
4x2 + 4xy − 5xy − 5y2
The numbers are 4 and − 5, split the middle term
4x(x + y) − 5y(x + y)
Factor by grouping
(x + y)(4x − 5y)
Our Solution
As always, when factoring we will ﬁrst look for a GCF before using any other
method, including the ac method. Factoring out the GCF ﬁrst also has the added
bonus of making the numbers smaller so the ac method becomes easier.
Example 298.
18x3 + 33x2 − 30x
GCF = 3x, factor this out ﬁrst
3x[6x2 + 11x − 10]
Multiply to ac or (6)( − 10) = − 60, add to 11
3x[6x2 + 15x − 4x − 10]
The numbers are 15 and − 4, split the middle term
3x[3x(2x + 5) − 2(2x + 5)]
Factor by grouping
3x(2x + 5)(3x − 2)
Our Solution
As was the case with trinomials when a = 1, not all trinomials can be factored. If
there is no combinations that multiply and add correctly then we can say the tri-
nomial is prime and cannot be factored.
Example 299.
3x2 + 2x − 7
Multiply to ac or (3)( − 7) = − 21, add to 2
− 3(7) and − 7(3)
Only two ways to multiply to − 21, it doesn′t add to 2
Prime, cannot be factored
Our Solution

Factoring - Factoring Special Products
Objective: Identify and factor special products including a diﬀerence of
squares, perfect squares, and sum and diﬀerence of cubes.
When factoring there are a few special products that, if we can recognize them,
can help us factor polynomials. The ﬁrst is one we have seen before. When multi-
plying special products we found that a sum and a diﬀerence could multiply to a
diﬀerence of squares. Here we will use this special product to help us factor
Diﬀerence of Squares: a2 − b2 = (a + b)(a − b)
If we are subtracting two perfect squares then it will always factor to the sum and
diﬀerence of the square roots.
Example 300.
x2 − 16
Subtracting two perfect squares, the square roots are x and 4
(x + 4)(x − 4)
Our Solution
Example 301.
9a2 − 25b2
Subtracting two perfect squares, the square roots are 3a and 5b
(3a + 5b)(3a − 5b)
Our Solution
It is important to note, that a sum of squares will never factor. It is always
prime. This can be seen if we try to use the ac method to factor x2 + 36.
Example 302.
x2 + 36
No bx term, we use 0x.
x2 + 0x + 36
Multiply to 36, add to 0
1 · 36, 2 · 18, 3 · 12, 4 · 9, 6 · 6
No combinations that multiply to 36 add to 0
Prime, cannot factor
Our Solution
229
It turns out that a sum of squares is always prime.
Sum of Squares: a2 + b2 = Prime
A great example where we see a sum of squares comes from factoring a diﬀerence
of 4th powers. Because the square root of a fourth power is a square (
a4
√
= a2),
we can factor a diﬀerence of fourth powers just like we factor a diﬀerence of
squares, to a sum and diﬀerence of the square roots. This will give us two factors,
one which will be a prime sum of squares, and a second which will be a diﬀerence
of squares which we can factor again. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 303.
a4 − b4
Diﬀerence of squares with roots a2 and b2
(a2 + b2)(a2 − b2)
The ﬁrst factor is prime, the second is a diﬀerence of squares!
(a2 + b2)(a + b)(a − b)
Our Solution
Example 304.
x4 − 16
Diﬀerence of squares with roots x2 and 4
(x2 + 4)(x2 − 4)
The ﬁrst factor is prime, the second is a diﬀerence of squares!
(x2 + 4)(x + 2)(x − 2)
Our Solution
Another factoring shortcut is the perfect square. We had a shortcut for multi-
plying a perfect square which can be reversed to help us factor a perfect square
Perfect Square: a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2
A perfect square can be diﬃcult to recognize at ﬁrst glance, but if we use the ac
method and get two of the same numbers we know we have a perfect square.
Then we can just factor using the square roots of the ﬁrst and last terms and the
sign from the middle. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 305.
x2 − 6x + 9
Multiply to 9, add to − 6
The numbers are − 3 and − 3, the same! Perfect square
(x − 3)2
Use square roots from ﬁrst and last terms and sign from the middle
230
Example 306.
4x2 + 20xy + 25y2
Multiply to 100, add to 20
The numbers are 10 and 10, the same! Perfect square
(2x + 5y)2
Usesquarerootsfromﬁrstandlasttermsandsignfromthemiddle
World View Note: The ﬁrst known record of work with polynomials comes
from the Chinese around 200 BC. Problems would be written as “three sheafs of a
good crop, two sheafs of a mediocre crop, and one sheaf of a bad crop sold for 29
dou. This would be the polynomial (trinomial) 3x + 2y + z = 29.
Another factoring shortcut has cubes. With cubes we can either do a sum or a
diﬀerence of cubes. Both sum and diﬀerence of cubes have very similar factoring
formulas
Sum of Cubes: a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 − ab + b2)
Diﬀerence of Cubes: a3 − b3 = (a − b)(a2 + ab + b2)
Comparing the formulas you may notice that the only diﬀerence is the signs in
between the terms. One way to keep these two formulas straight is to think of
SOAP. S stands for Same sign as the problem. If we have a sum of cubes, we add
ﬁrst, a diﬀerence of cubes we subtract ﬁrst. O stands for Opposite sign. If we
have a sum, then subtraction is the second sign, a diﬀerence would have addition
for the second sign. Finally, AP stands for Always Positive. Both formulas end
with addition. The following examples show factoring with cubes.
Example 307.
m3 − 27
We have cube roots m and 3
(m
3)(m2
3m
9)
Use formula, use SOAP to ﬁll in signs
(m − 3)(m2 + 3m + 9)
Our Solution
Example 308.
125p3 + 8r3
We have cube roots 5p and 2r
(5p
2r)(25p2
10r
4r2)
Use formula, use SOAP to ﬁll in signs
(5p + 2r)(25p2 − 10r + 4r2)
Our Solution
The previous example illustrates an important point. When we ﬁll in the trino-
mial’s ﬁrst and last terms we square the cube roots 5p and 2r. Often students
forget to square the number in addition to the variable. Notice that when done
correctly, both get cubed.
231
Often after factoring a sum or diﬀerence of cubes, students want to factor the
second factor, the trinomial further. As a general rule, this factor will always be
prime (unless there is a GCF which should have been factored out before using
cubes rule).
The following table sumarizes all of the shortcuts that we can use to factor special
products
Factoring Special Products
Diﬀerence of Squares
a2 − b2 = (a + b)(a − b)
Sum of Squares
a2 + b2 = Prime
Perfect Square
a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2
Sum of Cubes
a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 − ab + b2)
Diﬀerence of Cubes
a3 − b3 = (a − b)(a2 + ab + b2)
As always, when factoring special products it is important to check for a GCF
ﬁrst. Only after checking for a GCF should we be using the special products.
This is shown in the following examples
Example 309.
72x2 − 2
GCF is 2
2(36x2 − 1)
Diﬀerence of Squares, square roots are 6x and 1
2(6x + 1)(6x − 1)

48x2y − 24xy + 3y
GCF is 3y
3y(16x2 − 8x + 1)
Multiply to 16 add to 8
The numbers are 4 and 4, the same! Perfect Square
3y(4x − 1)2
Our Solution
Example 311.
128a4b2 + 54ab5
GCF is 2ab2
2ab2(64a3 + 27b3)
Sum of cubes! Cube roots are 4a and 3b
2ab2(4a + 3b)(16a2 − 12ab + 9b2)

Factoring - Factoring Strategy
Objective: Idenﬁty and use the correct method to factor various poly-
nomials.
With so many diﬀerent tools used to factor, it is easy to get lost as to which tool
to use when. Here we will attempt to organize all the diﬀerent factoring types we
have seen. A large part of deciding how to solve a problem is based on how many
terms are in the problem. For all problem types we will always try to factor out
the GCF ﬁrst.
Factoring Strategy (GCF First!!!!!)
•
2 terms: sum or diﬀerence of squares or cubes:
a2 − b2 = (a + b)(a − b)
a2 + b2 = Prime
a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 − ab + b2)
a3 − b3 = (a − b)(a2 + ab + b2)
•
3 terms: ac method, watch for perfect square!
a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2
Multiply to ac and add to b
•
4 terms: grouping
We will use the above strategy to factor each of the following examples. Here the
emphasis will be on which strategy to use rather than the steps used in that
method.
Example 312.
4x2 + 56xy + 196y2
GCF ﬁrst, 4
4(x2 + 14xy + 49y2)
Three terms, try ac method, multiply to 49, add to 14
7 and 7, perfect square!
234
4(x + 7y)2
Our Solution
Example 313.
5x 2y + 15xy − 35x2 − 105x
GCF ﬁrst, 5x
5x(xy + 3y − 7x − 21)
Four terms, try grouping
5x[y(x + 3) − 7(x + 3)]
(x + 3) match!
5x(x + 3)(y − 7)
Our Solution
Example 314.
100x2 − 400
GCF ﬁrst, 100
100(x2 − 4)
Two terms, diﬀerence of squares
100(x + 4)(x − 4)
Our Solution
Example 315.
108x3y2 − 39x2y2 + 3xy2
GCF ﬁrst, 3xy2
3xy2(36x2 − 13x + 1)
Thee terms, ac method, multiply to 36, add to − 13
3xy2(36x2 − 9x − 4x + 1)
− 9 and − 4, split middle term
3xy2[9x(4x − 1) − 1(4x − 1)]
Factor by grouping
3xy2(4x − 1)(9x − 1)
Our Solution
World View Note: Variables originated in ancient Greece where Aristotle would
use a single capital letter to represent a number.
Example 316.
5 + 625y3
GCF ﬁrst, 5
5(1 + 125y3)
Two terms, sum of cubes
5(1 + 5y)(1 − 5y + 25y2)
Our Solution
It is important to be comfortable and conﬁdent not just with using all the fac-
toring methods, but decided on which method to use. This is why practice is very
important!

Factoring - Solve by Factoring
Objective: Solve quadratic equation by factoring and using the zero
product rule.
When solving linear equations such as 2x − 5 = 21 we can solve for the variable
directly by adding 5 and dividing by 2 to get 13. However, when we have x2 (or a
higher power of x) we cannot just isolate the variable as we did with the linear
equations. One method that we can use to solve for the varaible is known as the
zero product rule
Zero Product Rule: If ab = 0 then either a = 0 or b = 0
The zero product rule tells us that if two factors are multiplied together and the
answer is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. We can use this to help us
solve factored polynomials as in the following example.
Example 317.
(2x − 3)(5x + 1) = 0
One factor must be zero
2x − 3 = 0 or 5x + 1 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
+ 3 + 3
− 1 − 1
Solve each equation
2x = 3 or 5x = − 1
2
2
5
5
x = 3
2 or − 1
5
Our Solution
For the zero product rule to work we must have factors to set equal to zero. This
means if the problem is not already factored we will factor it ﬁrst.
Example 318.
4x2 + x − 3 = 0
Factor using the ac method, multiply to − 12, add to 1
4x2 − 3x + 4x − 3 = 0
The numbers are − 3 and 4, split the middle term
x(4x − 3) + 1(4x − 3) = 0
Factor by grouping
(4x − 3)(x + 1) = 0
One factor must be zero
4x − 3 = 0 or x + 1 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
237
+ 3 + 3
− 1 − 1
Solve each equation
4x = 3 or x = − 1
4
4
x = 3
4 or − 1
Our Solution
Another important part of the zero product rule is that before we factor, the
equation must equal zero. If it does not, we must move terms around so it does
equal zero. Generally we like the x2 term to be positive.
Example 319.
x2 = 8x − 15
Set equal to zero by moving terms to the left
− 8x + 15 − 8x + 15
x2 − 8x + 15 = 0
Factor using the ac method, multiply to 15, add to − 8
(x − 5)(x − 3) = 0
The numbers are − 5 and − 3
x − 5 = 0 or x − 3 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
+ 5 + 5
+ 3 + 3
Solve each equation
x = 5 or x = 3
Our Solution
Example 320.
(x − 7)(x + 3) = − 9
Not equal to zero, multiply ﬁrst, use FOIL
x2 − 7x + 3x − 21 = − 9
Combine like terms
x2 − 4x − 21 = − 9
Move − 9 to other side so equation equals zero
+ 9
+ 9
x2 − 4x − 12 = 0
Factor using the ac method, mutiply to − 12, add to − 4
(x − 6)(x + 2) = 0
The numbers are 6 and − 2
x − 6 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
+ 6 + 6
− 2 − 2
Solve each equation
x = 6 or − 2
Our Solution
Example 321.
3x2 + 4x − 5 = 7x2 + 4x − 14
Set equal to zero by moving terms to the right
− 3x2 − 4x + 5
− 3x2 − 4x + 5
0 = 4x2 − 9
Factor using diﬀerence of squares
238
0 = (2x + 3)(2x − 3)
One factor must be zero
2x + 3 = 0 or 2x − 3 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
− 3 − 3
+ 3 + 3
Solve each equation
2x = − 3 or 2x = 3
2
2
2
2
x = − 3
2
or 3
2
Our Solution
Most problems with x2 will have two unique solutions. However, it is possible to
have only one solution as the next example illustrates.
Example 322.
4x2 = 12x − 9
Set equal to zero by moving terms to left
− 12x + 9
− 12x + 9
4x2 − 12x + 9 = 0
Factor using the ac method, multiply to 36, add to − 12
(2x − 3)2 = 0
− 6 and − 6, a perfect square!
2x − 3 = 0
Set this factor equal to zero
+ 3 + 3
Solve the equation
2x = 3
2
2
x = 3
2
Our Solution
As always it will be important to factor out the GCF ﬁrst if we have one. This
GCF is also a factor and must also be set equal to zero using the zero product
rule. This may give us more than just two solution. The next few examples illus-
trate this.
Example 323.
4x2 = 8x
Set equal to zero by moving the terms to left
− 8x − 8x
Be careful, on the right side, they are not like terms!
4x2 − 8x = 0
Factor out the GCF of 4x
4x(x − 2) = 0
One factor must be zero
4x = 0 or x − 2 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
4

+ 2 + 2
Solve each equation
x = 0 or 2
Our Solution
239
Example 324.
2x3 − 14x2 + 24x = 0
Factor out the GCF of 2x
2x(x2 − 7x + 12) = 0
Factor with ac method, multiply to 12, add to − 7
2x(x − 3)(x − 4) = 0
The numbers are − 3 and − 4
2x = 0 or x − 3 = 0 or x − 4 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
2
2
+ 3 + 3
+ 4 + 4
Solve each equation
x = 0 or 3 or 4
Our Solutions
Example 325.
6x2 + 21x − 27 = 0
Factor out the GCF of 3
3(2x2 + 7x − 9) = 0
Factor with ac method, multiply to − 18, add to 7
3(2x2 + 9x − 2x − 9) = 0
The numbers are 9 and − 2
3[x(2x + 9) − 1(2x + 9)] = 0
Factor by grouping
3(2x + 9)(x − 1) = 0
One factor must be zero
3 = 0 or 2x + 9 = 0 or x − 1 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
3
� 0
− 9 − 9
+ 1 + 1
Solve each equation
2x = − 9 or x = 1
2
2
x = − 9
2 or 1
Our Solution
In the previous example, the GCF did not have a variable in it. When we set this
factor equal to zero we got a false statement. No solutions come from this factor.
Often a student will skip setting the GCF factor equal to zero if there is no vari-
ables in the GCF.
Just as not all polynomials cannot factor, all equations cannot be solved by fac-
toring. If an equation does not factor we will have to solve it using another
method. These other methods are saved for another section.
World View Note: While factoring works great to solve problems with x2,
Tartaglia, in 16th century Italy, developed a method to solve problems with x3.
He kept his method a secret until another mathematician, Cardan, talked him out
of his secret and published the results. To this day the formula is known as
Cardan’s Formula.
A question often asked is if it is possible to get rid of the square on the variable
by taking the square root of both sides. While it is possible, there are a few prop-
erties of square roots that we have not covered yet and thus it is common to
break a rule of roots that we are not aware of at this point. The short reason we
want to avoid this for now is because taking a square root will only give us one of
the two answers. When we talk about roots we will come back to problems like
these and see how we can solve using square roots in a method called completing
the square. For now, never take the square root of both sides!

Rational Expressions - Reduce Rational Expressions
Objective: Reduce rational expressions by dividing out common fac-
tors.
Rational expressions are expressions written as a quotient of polynomials.
Examples of rational expressions include:
x2 − x − 12
x2 − 9x + 20
and
3
x − 2
and
a − b
b − a
and
3
2
As rational expressions are a special type of fraction, it is important to remember
with fractions we cannot have zero in the denominator of a fraction. For this
reason, rational expressions may have one more excluded values, or values that
the variable cannot be or the expression would be undeﬁned.
Example 326.
State the excluded value(s): x2 − 1
3x2 + 5x
Denominator cannot be zero
3x2 + 5x
� 0
Factor
x(3x + 5)
� 0
Set each factor not equal to zero
x
� 0 or 3x + 5
� 0
Subtract 5 from second equation
− 5 − 5
3x
� − 5
Divide by 3
3
3
x
� − 5
3
Second equation is solved
x
� 0 or − 5
3
Our Solution
This means we can use any value for x in the equation except for 0 and − 5
3 . We
243
can however, evaluate any other value in the expression.
World View Note: The number zero was not widely accepted in mathematical
thought around the world for many years. It was the Mayans of Central America
who ﬁrst used zero to aid in the use of their base 20 system as a place holder!
Rational expressions are easily evaluated by simply substituting the value for the
variable and using order of operations.
Example 327.
x2 − 4
x2 + 6x + 8 when x = − 6
Substitute − 5 in for each variable
( − 6)2 − 4
( − 6)2 + 6( − 6) + 8
Exponents ﬁrst
36 − 4
36 + 6( − 6) + 8
Multiply
36 − 4
36 − 36 + 8
Add and subtract
32
8
Reduce
4
Our Solution
Just as we reduced the previous example, often a rational expression can be
reduced, even without knowing the value of the variable. When we reduce we
divide out common factors. We have already seen this with monomials when we
discussed properties of exponents. If the problem only has monomials we can
reduce the coeﬃcients, and subtract exponents on the variables.
Example 328.
15x4y2
25x2y6
Reduce , subtract exponents. Negative exponents move to denominator
3x2
5y4
Our Solution
244
However, if there is more than just one term in either the numerator or denomi-
nator, we can’t divide out common factors unless we ﬁrst factor the numerator
and denominator.
Example 329.
28
8x2 − 16
Denominator has a common factor of 8
28
8(x2 − 2)
Reduce by dividing 24 and 8 by 4
7
2(x2 − 2)
Our Solution
Example 330.
9x − 3
18x − 6
Numerator has a common factor of 3, denominator of 6
3(3x − 1)
6(3x − 1)
Divide out common factor (3x − 1) and divide 3 and 6 by 3
1
2
Our Solution
Example 331.
x2 − 25
x2 + 8x + 15
Numerator is diﬀerence of squares, denominator is factored using ac
(x + 5)(x − 5)
(x + 3)(x + 5)
Divide out common factor (x + 5)
x − 5
x + 3
Our Solution
It is important to remember we cannot reduce terms, only factors. This means if
there are any + or − between the parts we want to reduce we cannot. In the pre-
vious example we had the solution
x − 5
x + 3, we cannot divide out the x’s because
they are terms (separated by + or − ) not factors (separated by multiplication).

Rational Expressions - Multiply & Divide
Objective: Multiply and divide rational expressions.
Multiplying and dividing rational expressions is very similar to the process we use
to multiply and divide fractions.
Example 332.

45
First reduce common factors from numerator and denominator (15 and 7)

7 · 2
3
Multiply numerators across and denominators across
2
21
Our Solution
The process is identical for division with the extra ﬁrst step of multiplying by the
reciprocal. When multiplying with rational expressions we follow the same pro-
cess, ﬁrst divide out common factors, then multiply straight across.

Rational Expressions - Least Common Denominators
Objective:
Idenﬁty
the
least
common
denominator
and
build
up
denominators to match this common denominator.
As with fractions, the least common denominator or LCD is very important to
working with rational expressions. The process we use to ﬁnd the LCD is based
on the process used to ﬁnd the LCD of intergers.
Example 338.
Find the LCD of 8 and 6
Consider multiples of the larger number
8, 16, 24 � .
24 is the ﬁrst multiple of 8 that is also divisible by 6
24
Our Solution
When ﬁnding the LCD of several monomials we ﬁrst ﬁnd the LCD of the coeﬃ-
cients, then use all variables and attach the highest exponent on each variable.
Example 339.
Find the LCD of 4x2y5 and 6x4y3z6
First ﬁnd the LCD of coeﬃcients 4 and 6
12
12 is the LCD of 4 and 6
x4y5z6
Use all variables with highest exponents on each variable
12x4y5z6
Our Solution
The same pattern can be used on polynomials that have more than one term.
However, we must ﬁrst factor each polynomial so we can identify all the factors to
be used (attaching highest exponent if necessary).
Example 340.
Find the LCD of x2 + 2x − 3 and x2 − x − 12
Factor each polynomial
(x − 1)(x + 3) and (x − 4)(x + 3)
LCD uses all unique factors
(x − 1)(x + 3)(x − 4)
Our Solution
Notice we only used (x + 3) once in our LCD. This is because it only appears as a
factor once in either polynomial. The only time we need to repeat a factor or use
an exponent on a factor is if there are exponents when one of the polynomials is
factored
253
Example 341.
Find the LCD of x2 − 10x + 25 and x2 − 14x + 45
Factor each polynomial
(x − 5)2 and (x − 5)(x − 9)
LCD uses all unique factors with highest exponent
(x − 5)2(x − 9)
Our Solution
The previous example could have also been done with factoring the ﬁrst polyno-
mial to (x − 5)(x − 5). Then we would have used (x − 5) twice in the LCD
because it showed up twice in one of the polynomials. However, it is the author’s
suggestion to use the exponents in factored form so as to use the same pattern
(highest exponent) as used with monomials.
Once we know the LCD, our goal will be to build up fractions so they have
matching denominators. In this lesson we will not be adding and subtracting frac-
tions, just building them up to a common denominator. We can build up a frac-
tion’s denominator by multipliplying the numerator and denoinator by any factors
that are not already in the denominator.
Example 342.
5a
3a2b =
?
6a5b3
Idenﬁty what factors we need to match denominators
2a3b2
3 · 2 = 6 and we need three more a′s and two more b′s
5a
3a2b
� 2a3b2
2a3b2
�
Multiply numerator and denominator by this
10a4b2
6a5b3
Our Solution
Example 343.
x − 2
x + 4 =
?
x2 + 7x + 12
Factor to idenﬁty factors we need to match denominators
(x + 4)(x + 3)
(x + 3)
The missing factor
x − 2
x + 4
� x + 3
x + 3
�
Multiply numerator and denominator by missing factor,
FOIL numerator
x2 + x − 6
(x + 4)(x + 3)
Our Solution
254
As the above example illustrates, we will multiply out our numerators, but keep
our denominators factored. The reason for this is to add and subtract fractions
we will want to be able to combine like terms in the numerator, then when we
reduce at the end we will want our denominators factored.
Once we know how to ﬁnd the LCD and how to build up fractions to a desired
denominator we can combine them together by ﬁnding a common denominator
and building up those fractions.
Example 344.
Build up each fraction so they have a common denominator
5a
4b3c and
3c
6a2b
First identify LCD
12a2b3c
Determine what factors each fraction is missing

x2 − 5x − 6 and
x − 2
x2 + 4x + 3

First: (x + 3) Second: (x − 6)

Multiply numerators
5x2 + 15x
(x − 6)(x + 1)(x + 3) and

Our Solution
World View Note: When the Egyptians began working with fractions, they
expressed all fractions as a sum of unit fraction. Rather than 4
5, they would write
the fraction as the sum, 1
2 + 1
4 +

20. An interesting problem with this system is
this is not a unique solution, 4
5 is also equal to the sum 1

Rational Expressions - Add & Subtract
Objective: Add and subtract rational expressions with and without
common denominators.
Adding and subtracting rational expressions is identical to adding and subtracting
with integers. Recall that when adding with a common denominator we add the
numerators and keep the denominator. This is the same process used with
rational expressions. Remember to reduce, if possible, your ﬁnal answer.
Example 346.
x − 4
x2 − 2x − 8 +
x + 8
x2 − 2x − 8
Same denominator, add numerators, combine like terms
2x + 4
x2 − 2x − 8
Factor numerator and denominator
2(x + 2)
(x + 2)(x − 4)
Divide out (x + 2)
2
x − 4
Our Solution
257
Subtraction with common denominator follows the same pattern, though the sub-
traction can cause problems if we are not careful with it. To avoid sign errors we
will ﬁrst distribute the subtraction through the numerator. Then we can treat it
like an addition problem. This process is the same as “add the opposite” we saw
when subtracting with negatives.
Example 347.
6x − 12
3x − 6 − 15x − 6
3x − 6
Add the opposite of the second fraction (distribute negative)
6x − 12
3x − 6 + − 15x + 6
3x − 6
Add numerators, combine like terms
− 9x − 6
3x − 6
Factor numerator and denominator
− 3(3x + 2)
3(x − 2)
Divide out common factor of 3
− (3x + 2)
x − 2
Our Solution
World View Note: The Rhind papyrus of Egypt from 1650 BC gives some of
the earliest known symbols for addition and subtraction, a pair of legs walking in
the direction one reads for addition, and a pair of legs walking in the opposite
direction for subtraction..
When we don’t have a common denominator we will have to ﬁnd the least
common denominator (LCD) and build up each fraction so the denominators
match. The following example shows this process with integers.
Example 348.

6a2b4
Reduce, dividing out factors 2, a, and b

Our Solution
The same process can be used for subtraction, we will simply add the ﬁrst step of
adding the opposite.
Example 350.

Add the opposite

� 5

�
Multiply ﬁrst fraction by 4a, second by 5
16a − 35b
20a2
Our Solution
If our denominators have more than one term in them we will need to factor ﬁrst
to ﬁnd the LCD. Then we build up each denominator using the factors that are
259
missing on each fraction.
Example 351.
6

With subtraction remember to add the opposite.

Rational Expressions - Complex Fractions
Objective: Simplify complex fractions by multiplying each term by the
least common denominator.
Complex fractions have fractions in either the numerator, or denominator, or usu-
ally both. These fractions can be simpliﬁed in one of two ways. This will be illus-
trated ﬁrst with integers, then we will consider how the process can be expanded
to include expressions with variables.
The ﬁrst method uses order of operations to simplify the numerator and denomi-
nator ﬁrst, then divide the two resulting fractions by multiplying by the recip-
rocal.

Our Solution
The process above works just ﬁne to simplify, but between getting common
denominators, taking reciprocals, and reducing, it can be a very involved process.
Generally we prefer a diﬀerent method, to multiply the numerator and denomi-
nator of the large fraction (in eﬀect each term in the complex fraction) by the
least common denominator (LCD). This will allow us to reduce and clear the
small fractions. We will simplify the same problem using this second method.
Example 354.

Our Solution
Clearly the second method is a much cleaner and faster method to arrive at our
solution. It is the method we will use when simplifying with variables as well. We
will ﬁrst ﬁnd the LCD of the small fractions, and multiply each term by this LCD
so we can clear the small fractions and simplify.
Example 355.

Distribute

5x + 20 + 2
Combine like terms

Our Solution
The more fractions we have in our problem, the more we repeat the same process.

ab

a2b
+ ab(a2b3) − 1(a2b3)
ab
Reduce each fraction (subtract exponents)
2ab − 3a + ab2
4b2 + a3b4 − ab2
Our Solution
World View Note: Sophie Germain is one of the most famous women in mathe-
matics, many primes, which are important to ﬁnding an LCD, carry her name.
Germain primes are prime numbers where one more than double the prime
number is also prime, for example 3 is prime and so is 2 · 3 + 1 = 7 prime. The
largest known Germain prime (at the time of printing) is 183027 · 2265440 − 1 which
has 79911 digits!
Some problems may require us to FOIL as we simplify. To avoid sign errors, if
there is a binomial in the numerator, we will ﬁrst distribute the negative through
the numerator.
Example 357.
x − 3
x + 3 − x + 3
x − 3
x − 3
x + 3 + x + 3
x − 3
Distribute the subtraction to numerator
x − 3
x + 3 + − x − 3
x − 3
x − 3
x + 3 + x + 3
x − 3
Identify LCD
264
LCD = (x + 3)(x − 3)
Multiply each term by LCD
(x − 3)(x + 3)(x − 3)
x + 3
+ ( − x − 3)(x + 3)(x − 3)
x − 3
(x − 3)(x + 3)(x − 3)
x + 3
+ (x + 3)(x + 3)(x − 3)
x − 3
Reduce fractions
(x − 3)(x − 3) + ( − x − 3)(x + 3)
(x − 3)(x − 3) + (x + 3)(x + 3)
FOIL
x2 − 6x + 9 − x2 − 6x − 9
x2 − 6x + 9 + x2 + 6x − 9
Combine like terms
− 12x
2x2 + 18
Factor out 2 in denominator
− 12x
2(x2 + 9)
Divide out common factor 2
− 6x
x2 − 9
Our Solution
If there are negative exponents in an expression we will have to ﬁrst convert these
negative exponents into fractions. Remember, the exponent is only on the factor
it is attached to, not the whole term.
Example 358.
m−2 + 2m−1
m + 4m−2
Make each negative exponent into a fraction
1
m2 + 2
m
m +
4
m2
Multiply each term by LCD, m2
1(m2)
m2 + 2(m2)
m
m(m2) + 4(m2)
m2
Reduce the fractions
1 + 2m
m3 + 4
Our Solution
Once we convert each negative exponent into a fraction, the problem solves
exactly like the other complex fraction problems.

Rational Expressions - Proportions
Objective: Solve proportions using the cross product and use propor-
tions to solve application problems
When two fractions are equal, they are called a proportion. This deﬁnition can be
generalized to two equal rational expressions. Proportions have an important
property called the cross-product.
Cross Product: If a
b = c
d then ad = bc
The cross product tells us we can multiply diagonally to get an equation with no
fractions that we can solve.
Example 359.
20
6 = x
9
Calculate cross product
268
(20)(9) = 6x
Multiply
180 = 6x
Divide both sides by 6
6
6
30 = x
Our Solution
World View Note: The ﬁrst clear deﬁnition of a proportion and the notation
for a proportion came from the German Leibniz who wrote, “I write dy: x = dt: a;
for dy is to x as dt is to a, is indeed the same as, dy divided by x is equal to dt
divided by a. From this equation follow then all the rules of proportion.”
If the proportion has more than one term in either numerator or denominator, we
will have to distribute while calculating the cross product.
Example 360.
x + 3
4
= 2
5
Calculate cross product
5(x + 3) = (4)(2)
Multiply and distribute
5x + 15 = 8
Solve
− 15 − 15
Subtract 15 from both sides
5x = − 7
Divide both sides by 5
5
5
x = − 7
5
Our Solution
This same idea can be seen when the variable appears in several parts of the pro-
portion.
Example 361.
4
x =
6
3x + 2
Calculate cross product
4(3x + 2) = 6x
Distribute
12x + 8 = 6x
Move variables to one side
− 12x
− 12x
Subtract 12x from both sides
8 = − 6x
Divide both sides by − 6
− 6
− 6
− 4
3 = x
Our Solution
269
Example 362.
2x − 3
7x + 4 = 2
5
Calculate cross product
5(2x − 3) = 2(7x + 4)
Distribute
10x − 15 = 14x + 8
Move variables to one side
− 10x
− 10x
Subtract 10x from both sides
− 15 = 4x + 8
Subtract 8 from both sides
− 8
− 8
− 23 = 4x
Divide both sides by 4
4
4
− 23
4 = x
Our Solution
As we solve proportions we may end up with a quadratic that we will have to
solve. We can solve this quadratic in the same way we solved quadratics in the
past, either factoring, completing the square or the quadratic formula. As with
solving quadratics before, we will generally end up with two solutions.
Example 363.
k + 3
3
=
8
k − 2
Calculate cross product
(k + 3)(k − 2) = (8)(3)
FOIL and multiply
k2 + k − 6 = 24
Make equation equal zero
− 24 − 24
Subtract 24 from both sides
k2 + k − 30 = 0
Factor
(k + 6)(k − 5) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
k + 6 = 0 or k − 5 = 0
Solve each equation
− 6 − 6
+ 5 = 5
Add or subtract
k = − 6 or k = 5
Our Solutions
Proportions are very useful in how they can be used in many diﬀerent types of
applications. We can use them to compare diﬀerent quantities and make conclu-
sions about how quantities are related. As we set up these problems it is impor-
tant to remember to stay organized, if we are comparing dogs and cats, and the
number of dogs is in the numerator of the ﬁrst fraction, then the numerator of the
second fraction should also refer to the dogs. This consistency of the numerator
and denominator is essential in setting up our proportions.
Example 364.
A six foot tall man casts a shadow that is 3.5 feet long. If the shadow of a ﬂag
pole is 8 feet long, how tall is the ﬂag pole?
shadow
height
We will put shadows in numerator, heights in denomintor
270
3.5
6
The man has a shadow of 3.5 feet and a height of 6 feet
8
x
The ﬂagpole has a shadow of 8 feet, but we don′t know the height
3.5
6 = 8
x
This gives us our proportion, calculate cross product
3.5x = (8)(6)
Multiply
3.5x = 48
Divide both sides by 3.5
3.5
3.5
x = 13.7ft
Our Solution
Example 365.
In a basketball game, the home team was down by 9 points at the end of the
game. They only scored 6 points for every 7 points the visiting team scored.
What was the ﬁnal score of the game?
home
visiter
We will put home in numerator, visitor in denominator
x − 9
x
Don′t know visitor score, but home is 9 points less
6
7
Home team scored 6 for every 7 the visitor scored
x − 9
x
= 6
7
This gives our proportion, calculate the cross product
7(x − 9) = 6x
Distribute
7x − 63 = 6x
Move variables to one side
− 7x
− 7x
Subtract 7x from both sides
− 63 = − x
Divide both sides by − 1
− 1
− 1
63 = x
We used x for the visitor score.
63 − 9 = 54
Subtract 9 to get the home score
63 to 54

Rational Expressions - Solving Rational Equations
Objective: Solve rational equations by identifying and multiplying by
the least common denominator.
When solving equations that are made up of rational expressions we will solve
them using the same strategy we used to solve linear equations with fractions.
When we solved problems like the next example, we cleared the fraction by multi-
plying by the least common denominator (LCD)

Our Solution
We will use the same process to solve rational equations, the only diﬀerence is our
274
LCD will be more involved. We will also have to be aware of domain issues. If our
LCD equals zero, the solution is undeﬁned. We will always check our solutions in
the LCD as we may have to remove a solution from our solution set.

Make equation equal zero

Subtract x2 from both sides
2x2 + 11x + 5 = 0
Factor
(2x + 1)(x + 5) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero

Our Solution
The LCD can be several factors in these problems. As the LCD gets more com-
plex, it is important to remember the process we are using to solve is still the
same.

275
x(x + 1) + 1(x + 2) = 5
Distribute

Combine like terms
x2 + 2x + 2 = 5
Make equatino equal zero
− 5 − 5
Subtract 6 from both sides
x2 + 2x − 3 = 0
Factor
(x + 3)(x − 1) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
x + 3 = 0 or x − 1 = 0
Solve each equation

x = − 3 or x = 1
Check solutions, LCD can′t be zero
( − 3 + 1)( − 3 + 2) = ( − 2)( − 1) = 2
Check − 3 in (x + 1)(x + 2), it works
(1 + 1)(1 + 2) = (2)(3) = 6
Check 1 in (x + 1)(x + 2), it works
x = − 3 or 1

will need to factor before ﬁnding the LCD

Multiply each term by LCD, reduce
x(x − 2) − 1(x − 1) = 11
Distribute
x2 − 2x − x + 1 = 11
Combine like terms
x2 − 3x + 1 = 11
Make equation equal zero

Subtract 11 from both sides
x2 − 3x − 10 = 0

Check 5 in (x − 1)(x − 2), it works
( − 2 − 1)( − 2 − 2) = ( − 3)( − 4) = 12
Check − 2 in (x − 1)(x − 2), it works

x = 5 or − 2
Our Solution
World View Note: Maria Agnesi was the ﬁrst women to publish a math text-
book in 1748, it took her over 10 years to write! This textbook covered everything
from arithmetic thorugh diﬀerential equations and was over 1,000 pages!
If we are subtracting a fraction in the problem, it may be easier to avoid a future
sign error by ﬁrst distributing the negative through the numerator.
Example 370.
x − 2
x − 3 − x + 2
x + 2 = 5
8
Distribute negative through numerator
x − 2
x − 3 + − x − 2
x + 2 = 5

Identify LCD, 8(x − 3)(x + 2), multiply each term
(x − 2)8(x − 3)(x + 2)
x − 3
+ ( − x − 2)8(x − 3)(x + 2)
x + 2
= 5 · 8(x − 3)(x + 2)
8
Reduce
8(x − 2)(x + 2) + 8( − x − 2)(x − 3) = 5(x − 3)(x + 2)
FOIL
8(x2 − 4) + 8( − x2 + x + 6) = 5(x2 − x − 6)
Distribute
8x2 − 32 − 8x2 + 8x + 48 = 5x2 − 5x − 30
Combine like terms
8x + 16 = 5x2 − 5x − 30
Make equation equal zero
− 8x − 16
− 8x − 16
Subtract 8x and 16
0 = 5x2 − 13x − 46
Factor
0 = (5x − 23)(x + 2)
Set each factor equal to zero

Solve each equation

Rational Expressions - Dimensional Analysis
Objective: Use dimensional analysis to preform single unit, dual unit,
square unit, and cubed unit conversions.
One application of rational expressions deals with converting units. When we con-
vert units of measure we can do so by multiplying several fractions together in a
process known as dimensional analysis. The trick will be to decide what fractions
to multiply. When multiplying, if we multiply by 1, the value of the expression
does not change. One written as a fraction can look like many diﬀerent things as
long as the numerator and denominator are identical in value. Notice the numer-
ator and denominator are not identical in appearance, but rather identical in
value. Below are several fractions, each equal to one where numerator and denom-
inator are identical in value.

1 = 4
4 =
1
2
2
4

1m

16oz =

60 min = 60 min
1hr
The last few fractions that include units are called conversion factors. We can
make a conversion factor out of any two measurements that represent the same
distance. For example, 1 mile = 5280 feet. We could then make a conversion
factor
1mi
5280ft because both values are the same, the fraction is still equal to one.
Similarly we could make a conversion factor 5280ft
1mi . The trick for conversions will
279
be to use the correct fractions.
The idea behind dimensional analysis is we will multiply by a fraction in such a
way that the units we don’t want will divide out of the problem. We found out
when multiplying rational expressions that if a variable appears in the numerator
and denominator we can divide it out of the expression. It is the same with units.
Consider the following conversion.
Example 371.
17.37 miles to feet
Write 17.37 miles as a fraction, put it over 1
� 17.37mi
1
�
To divide out the miles we need miles in the denominator
� 17.37mi
1
�� ??ft
??mi
�
We are converting to feet, so this will go in the numerator
� 17.37mi
1
�� 5280ft
1mi
�
Fill in the relationship described above, 1 mile = 5280 feet
� 17.37
1
�� 5280ft
1
�
Divide out the miles and multiply across
91, 713.6ft
Our Solution
In the previous example, we had to use the conversion factor
5280ft
1mi
so the miles
would divide out. If we had used
1mi
5280ft we would not have been able to divide out
the miles. This is why when doing dimensional analysis it is very important to
use units in the set-up of the problem, so we know how to correctly set up the
conversion factor.
Example 372.
If 1 pound = 16 ounces, how many pounds 435 ounces?
� 435oz
1
�
Write 435 as a fraction, put it over 1
� 435oz
1
�� ?? lbs
??oz
�
To divide out oz,
put it in the denominator and lbs in numerator
� 435oz
1
�� 1 lbs
16oz
�
Fill in the given relationship, 1 pound = 16 ounces
280
� 435
1
�� 1 lbs
16
�
= 435 lbs
16
Divide out oz, multiply across. Divide result
27.1875 lbs
Our Solution
The same process can be used to convert problems with several units in them.
Consider the following example.
Example 373.
A student averaged 45 miles per hour on a trip. What was the student’s speed in
feet per second?
� 45mi

Our Solution
If the units are two-dimensional (such as square inches - in2) or three-dimensional
(such as cubic feet - ft3) we will need to put the same exponent on the conversion
factor. So if we are converting square inches (in2) to square ft (ft2), the conversion
factor would be squared,
�
1ft
12in
�2
. Similarly if the units are cubed, we will cube
the convesion factor.
Example 374.
Convert 8 cubic feet to yd3
Write 8ft3 as fraction, put it over 1
� 8ft3
1
�
To clear ft, put them in denominator, yard in numerator
281
� 8ft3

Because the units are cubed,
we cube the conversion factor

When calculating area or volume, be sure to use the units and multiply them as
well.
Example 375.

the end of this lesson which includes several conversion factors for length, volume,
mass and time in both English and Metric units.
The process of dimensional analysis can be used to convert other types of units as
well. If we can identify relationships that represent the same value we can make
them into a conversion factor.
Example 376.

his prescription twice. If a there are 60 tablets in a prescription, and each tablet
has 4 mg, how many doses are in the 3 prescriptions (original + 2 reﬁlls)?

Radicals - Square Roots
Objective: Simplify expressions with square roots.
Square roots are the most common type of radical used. A square root “un-
squares” a number. For example, because 52 = 25 we say the square root of 25 is 5.
The square root of 25 is written as
25
√
.
World View Note: The radical sign, when ﬁrst used was an R with a line
through the tail, similar to our perscription symbol today. The R came from the
latin, “radix”, which can be translated as “source” or “foundation”. It wasn’t until
the 1500s that our current symbol was ﬁrst used in Germany (but even then it
was just a check mark with no bar over the numbers!
The following example gives several square roots:
Example 377.
1
√
= 1
121
√
= 11
4
√
= 2
625
√
= 25
9
√
= 3
√− 81
= Undeﬁned
The ﬁnal example,
√− 81
is currently undeﬁned as negatives have no square root.
This is because if we square a positive or a negative, the answer will be positive.
Thus we can only take square roots of positive numbers. In another lesson we will
deﬁne a method we can use to work with and evaluate negative square roots, but
for now we will simply say they are undeﬁned.
Not all numbers have a nice even square root. For example, if we found
8
√
on
our calculator, the answer would be 2.828427124746190097603377448419... and
even this number is a rounded approximation of the square root. To be as accu-
rate as possible, we will never use the calculator to ﬁnd decimal approximations of
square roots. Instead we will express roots in simplest radical form. We will do
this using a property known as the product rule of radicals
Product Rule of Square Roots:
a · b
√
=
√a
·
b
√
We can use the product rule to simplify an expression such as
36 · 5
√
by spliting
it into two roots,
36
√
·
5
√
, and simplifying the ﬁrst root, 6
5
√
. The trick in this
288
process is being able to translate a problem like
180
√
into
36 · 5
√
. There are sev-
eral ways this can be done. The most common and, with a bit of practice, the
fastest method, is to ﬁnd perfect squares that divide evenly into the radicand, or
number under the radical. This is shown in the next example.
Example 378.
75
√
75 is divisible by 25, a perfect square
25 · 3
√
Split into factors
25
√
·
3
√
Product rule, take the square root of 25

√
Our Solution
If there is a coeﬃcient in front of the radical to begin with, the problem merely
becomes a big multiplication problem.

As we simplify radicals using this method it is important to be sure our ﬁnal
answer can be simpliﬁed no more.

Our Solution.
The previous example could have been done in fewer steps if we had noticed that
72 = 36 · 2, but often the time it takes to discover the larger perfect square is more
than it would take to simplify in several steps.
Variables often are part of the radicand as well. When taking the square roots of
variables, we can divide the exponent by 2. For example,
x8
√
= x4, because we
divide the exponent of 8 by 2. This follows from the power of a power rule of
expoennts, (x4)2 = x8. When squaring, we multiply the exponent by two, so when
taking a square root we divide the exponent by 2. This is shown in the following
example.

Our Solution
We can’t always evenly divide the exponent on a variable by 2. Sometimes we
have a remainder. If there is a remainder, this means the remainder is left inside
the radical, and the whole number part is how many are outside the radical. This
is shown in the following example.

Radicals - Higher Roots
Objective: Simplify radicals with an index greater than two.
While square roots are the most common type of radical we work with, we can
take higher roots of numbers as well: cube roots, fourth roots, ﬁfth roots, etc. Fol-
lowing is a deﬁnition of radicals.
m√a
= b if bm= a
The small letter m inside the radical is called the index. It tells us which root we
are taking, or which power we are “un-doing”. For square roots the index is 2. As
this is the most common root, the two is not usually written.
World View Note: The word for root comes from the French mathematician
Franciscus Vieta in the late 16th century.
The following example includes several higher roots.
Example 383.
125
3√
= 5
3√− 64
= − 4
81
4√
= 3
− 128
7√
= − 2
32
5√
= 2
4√− 16
= undeﬁned
We must be careful of a few things as we work with higher roots. First its impor-
tant not to forget to check the index on the root.
81
√
= 9 but
81
4√
= 3. This is
because 92 = 81 and 34 = 81. Another thing to watch out for is negatives under
roots. We can take an odd root of a negative number, because a negative number
raised to an odd power is still negative. However, we cannot take an even root of
a negative number, this we will say is undeﬁned. In a later section we will discuss
how to work with roots of negative, but for now we will simply say they are unde-
ﬁned.
We can simplify higher roots in much the same way we simpliﬁed square roots,
using the product property of radicals.
Product Property of Radicals:
ab
m√
=
m√a
·
b
m√
Often we are not as familiar with higher powers as we are with squares. It is
important to remember what index we are working with as we try and work our
way to the solution.
292
Example 384.
54
3√
We are working with a cubed root, want third powers
23 = 8
Test 2, 23 = 8, 54 is not divisible by 8.
33 = 27
Test 3, 33 = 27, 54 is divisible by 27!

Just as with square roots, if we have a coeﬃcient, we multiply the new coeﬃcients
together.

24 = 16

4√
Our Solution
We can also take higher roots of variables. As we do, we will divide the exponent
on the variable by the index. Any whole answer is how many of that varible will
come out of the square root. Any remainder is how many are left behind inside
the square root. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 386.
x25y17z3
5�
Divide each exponent by 5, whole number outside, remainder inside
x5y3
y2z3
5�
Our Solution
In the previous example, for the x, we divided 25
5 = 5R 0, so x5 came out, no x’s
remain inside. For the y, we divided 17
5 = 3R2, so y3 came out, and y2 remains
inside. For the z, when we divided 3
5 = 0R3, all three or z3 remained inside. The
following example includes integers in our problem.

Radicals - Adding Radicals
Objective: Add like radicals by ﬁrst simplifying each radical.
Adding and subtracting radicals is very similar to adding and subtracting with
variables. Consider the following example.

Notice that when we combined the terms with

√
it was just like combining
terms with x. When adding and subtracting with radicals we can combine like
radicals just as like terms. We add and subtract the coeﬃcients in front of the
295
radical, and the radical stays the same. This is shown in the following example.

Radicals - Multiply and Divide Radicals
Objective: Multiply and divide radicals using the product and quotient
rules of radicals.
Multiplying radicals is very simple if the index on all the radicals match. The
prodcut rule of radicals which we have already been using can be generalized as
follows:
Product Rule of Radicals: a
b
m√
· c
d
m√
= ac
bd
m√
Another way of stating this rule is we are allowed to multiply the factors outside
the radical and we are allowed to multiply the factors inside the radicals, as long
as the index matches. This is shown in the following example.

Our Solution
As we are multiplying we always look at our ﬁnal solution to check if all the radi-
cals are simpliﬁed and all like radicals or like terms have been combined.
Division with radicals is very similar to multiplication, if we think about division
as reducing fractions, we can reduce the coeﬃcients outside the radicals and
reduce the values inside the radicals to get our ﬁnal solution.

Our Solution
There is one catch to dividing with radicals, it is considered bad practice to have
a radical in the denominator of our ﬁnal answer. If there is a radical in the
denominator we will rationalize it, or clear out any radicals in the denominator.
299
We do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same thing.
The problems we will consider here will all have a monomial in the denominator.
The way we clear a monomial radical in the denominator is to focus on the index.
The index tells us how many of each factor we will need to clear the radical. For
example, if the index is 4, we will need 4 of each factor to clear the radical. This
is shown in the following examples.
Example 398.

The previous example could have been solved by multiplying numerator and

. However, this would have made the numbers very large
and we would have needed to reduce our soultion at the end. This is why re-
writing the radical as
52
3√
and multiplying by just
5
3√
was the better way to sim-
plify.
We will also always want to reduce our fractions (inside and out of the radical)
before we rationalize.

Radicals - Rationalize Denominators
Objective: Rationalize the denominators of radical expressions.
It is considered bad practice to have a radical in the denominator of a fraction.
When this happens we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same
thing in order to clear the radical. In the lesson on dividing radicals we talked
about how this was done with monomials. Here we will look at how this is done
with binomials.
If the binomial is in the numerator the process to rationalize the denominator is
essentially the same as with monomials. The only diﬀerence is we will have to dis-
tribute in the numerator.

Our Solution
It is important to remember that when reducing the fraction we cannot reduce
with just the 3 and 12 or just the 9 and 12. When we have addition or subtrac-
tion in the numerator or denominator we must divide all terms by the same
number.
The problem can often be made easier if we ﬁrst simplify any radicals in the
problem.

Our Solution
As we are rationalizing it will always be important to constantly check our
problem to see if it can be simpliﬁed more. We ask ourselves, can the fraction be
reduced? Can the radicals be simpliﬁed? These steps may happen several times
on our way to the solution.
If the binomial occurs in the denominator we will have to use a diﬀerent strategy
to clear the radical. Consider
2
3
√
− 5, if we were to multiply the denominator by
3
√
we would have to distribute it and we would end up with 3 − 5
3
√
. We have
not cleared the radical, only moved it to another part of the denominator. So our
current method will not work. Instead we will use what is called a conjugate. A
conjugate is made up of the same terms, with the opposite sign in the middle.
So for our example with
3
√
− 5 in the denominator, the conjugate would be
3
√
+
5. The advantage of a conjugate is when we multiply them together we have
(
3
√
− 5)(
3
√
+ 5), which is a sum and a diﬀerence. We know when we multiply
these we get a diﬀerence of squares. Squaring
3
√
and 5, with subtraction in the
middle gives the product 3 − 25 = − 22. Our answer when multiplying conjugates
will no longer have a square root. This is exactly what we want.

Radicals - Rational Exponents
Objective: Convert between radical notation and exponential notation
and simplify expressions with rational exponents using the properties
of exponents.
When we simplify radicals with exponents, we divide the exponent by the index.
Another way to write division is with a fraction bar. This idea is how we will
deﬁne rational exponents.
Deﬁnition of Rational Exponents: a
n
m = (
a
m√ )n
The denominator of a rational exponent becomes the index on our radical, like-
wise the index on the radical becomes the denominator of the exponent. We can
use this property to change any radical expression into an exponential expression.

We can also change any rational exponent into a radical expression by using the
denominator as the index.

ever his notation went largely unnoticed.
The ability to change between exponential expressions and radical expressions
allows us to evaluate problems we had no means of evaluating before by changing
to a radical.

The largest advantage of being able to change a radical expression into an expo-

When adding and subtracting with fractions we need to be sure to have a
common denominator. When multiplying we only need to multiply the numera-
tors together and denominators together. The following examples show several
diﬀerent problems, using diﬀerent properties to simplify the rational exponents.

Our Solution
It is important to remember that as we simplify with rational exponents we are
using the exact same properties we used when simplifying integer exponents. The
only diﬀerence is we need to follow our rules for fractions as well. It may be worth
reviewing your notes on exponent properties to be sure your comfortable with
using the properties.

Radicals - Radicals of Mixed Index
Objective: Reduce the index on a radical and multiply or divide radi-
cals of diﬀerent index.
Knowing that a radical has the same properties as exponents (written as a ratio)
allows us to manipulate radicals in new ways. One thing we are allowed to do is
reduce, not just the radicand, but the index as well. This is shown in the fol-
lowing example.
Example 417.

4�
Our Solution
What we have done is reduced our index by dividing the index and all the expo-
nents by the same number (2 in the previous example). If we notice a common
factor in the index and all the exponnets on every factor we can reduce by
dividing by that common factor. This is shown in the next example
Example 418.
a6b9c15
24√
Index and all exponents are divisible by 3
a2b3c5
8√
Our Solution
We can use the same process when there are coeﬃcients in the problem. We will
ﬁrst write the coeﬃcient as an exponential expression so we can divide the
exponet by the common factor as well.
Example 419.
8m6n3
9√
Write 8 as 23
23m6n3

Our Solution
We can use a very similar idea to also multiply radicals where the index does not
match. First we will consider an example using rational exponents, then identify
the pattern we can use.

Our Solution
To combine the radicals we need a common index (just like the common denomi-
nator). We will get a common index by multiplying each index and exponent by
an integer that will allow us to build up to that desired index. This process is
shown in the next example.

Often after combining radicals of mixed index we will need to simplify the
resulting radical.

Just as with reducing the index, we will rewrite coeﬃcients as exponential expres-
sions. This will also allow us to use exponent properties to simplify.

Our Solution
315
If there is a binomial in the radical then we need to keep that binomial together
through the entire problem.
Example 424.
3x(y + z)

9x(y + z)2
3�
Rewrite 9 as 32
3x(y + z)
�
32x(y + z)2

Common index: 6. Multiply ﬁrst group by 3, second by 2
33x3(y + z)334x2(y + z)4
6�
Add exponents, keep (y + z) as binomial
37x5(y + z)7
6�
Simplify, dividing exponent by index, remainder inside
3(y + z)
3x5(y + z)

Our Solution
World View Note: Originally the radical was just a check mark with the rest of
the radical expression in parenthesis. In 1637 Rene Descartes was the ﬁrst to put
a line over the entire radical expression.
The same process is used for dividing mixed index as with multiplying mixed
index. The only diﬀerence is our ﬁnal answer cannot have a radical over the
denominator.

Radicals - Complex Numbers
Objective: Add, subtract, multiply, rationalize, and simplify expres-
sions using complex numbers.
World View Note: When mathematics was ﬁrst used, the primary purpose was
for counting. Thus they did not originally use negatives, zero, fractions or irra-
tional numbers. However, the ancient Egyptians quickly developed the need for “a
part” and so they made up a new type of number, the ratio or fraction. The
Ancient Greeks did not believe in irrational numbers (people were killed for
believing otherwise). The Mayans of Central America later made up the number
zero when they found use for it as a placeholder. Ancient Chinese Mathematicians
made up negative numbers when they found use for them.
In mathematics, when the current number system does not provide the tools to
solve the problems the culture is working with, we tend to make up new ways for
dealing with the problem that can solve the problem. Throughout history this has
been the case with the need for a number that is nothing (0), smaller than zero
(negatives), between integers (fractions), and between fractions (irrational num-
bers). This is also the case for the square roots of negative numbers. To work
with the square root of negative numbers mathematicians have deﬁned what are
called imaginary and complex numbers.
Deﬁnition of Imaginary Numbers: i2 = − 1 (thus i =
√− 1
)
Examples of imaginary numbers include 3i, − 6i,
3
5i and 3i
5
√
. A complex
number is one that contains both a real and imaginary part, such as 2 + 5i.
With this deﬁnition, the square root of a negative number is no longer undeﬁned.
We now are allowed to do basic operations with the square root of negatives.
First we will consider exponents on imaginary numbers. We will do this by
manipulating our deﬁnition of i2 = − 1. If we multiply both sides of the deﬁnition
by i, the equation becomes i3 = − i. Then if we multiply both sides of the equa-
tion again by i, the equation becomes i4 = − i2 = − ( − 1) = 1, or simply i4 = 1.
Multiplying again by i gives i5 = i. One more time gives i6 = i2 = − 1. And if this
pattern continues we see a cycle forming, the exponents on i change we cycle
through simpliﬁed answers of i, − 1, − i, 1. As there are 4 diﬀerent possible
answers in this cycle, if we divide the exponent by 4 and consider the remainder,
we can simplify any exponent on i by learning just the following four values:
Cyclic Property of Powers of i
i0 = 1
i = i
i2 = − 1
i3 = − i
318
Example 426.

Simplify
− i
Our Solution
Example 427.
i124
Divide exponent by 4
31R0
Use remainder as exponent on i
i0
Simplify
1
Our Solution
When performing operations (add, subtract, multilpy, divide) we can handle i just
like we handle any other variable. This means when adding and subtracting com-
plex numbers we simply add or combine like terms.
Example 428.
(2 + 5i) + (4 − 7i)
Combine like terms 2 + 4 and 5i − 7i
6 − 2i
Our Solution
It is important to notice what operation we are doing. Students often see the
parenthesis and think that means FOIL. We only use FOIL to multiply. This
problem is an addition problem so we simply add the terms, or combine like
terms.
For subtraction problems the idea is the same, we need to remember to ﬁrst dis-
tribute the negative onto all the terms in the parentheses.
Example 429.
(4 − 8i) − (3 − 5i)
Distribute the negative
4 − 8i − 3 + 5i
Combine like terms 4 − 3 and − 8i + 5i
1 − 3i
Our Solution
Addition and subtraction can be combined into one problem.
Example 430.
(5i) − (3 + 8i) + ( − 4 + 7i)
Distribute the negative
5i − 3 − 8i − 4 + 7i
Combine like terms 5i − 8i + 7i and − 3 − 4
− 7 + 4i
Our Solution
Multiplying with complex numbers is the same as multiplying with variables with
one exception, we will want to simplify our ﬁnal answer so there are no exponents
on i.

Simplify i2 = − 1 and i3 = − i
36( − 1) − 54( − i)
Multiply
− 36 + 54i
Our Solution
Remember when squaring a binomial we either have to FOIL or use our shortcut
to square the ﬁrst, twice the product and square the last. The next example uses
the shortcut
Example 435.
(4 − 5i)2
Use perfect square shortcut
42 = 16
Square the ﬁrst
2(4)( − 5i) = − 40i
Twice the product
(5i)2 = 25i2 = 25( − 1) = − 25
Square the last, simplify i2 = − 1
16 − 40i − 25
Combine like terms
− 9 − 40i
Our Solution
320
Dividing with complex numbers also has one thing we need to be careful of. If i is
− 1
√
, and it is in the denominator of a fraction, then we have a radical in the
denominator! This means we will want to rationalize our denominator so there
are no i’s. This is done the same way we rationalized denominators with square
roots.

Using i we can simplify radicals with negatives under the root. We will use the
product rule and simplify the negative as a factor of negative one. This is shown
in the following examples.

Quadratics - Solving with Radicals
Objective: Solve equations with radicals and check for extraneous solu-
tions.
Here we look at equations that have roots in the problem. As you might expect,
to clear a root we can raise both sides to an exponent. So to clear a square root
we can rise both sides to the second power. To clear a cubed root we can raise
both sides to a third power. There is one catch to solving a problem with roots in
it, sometimes we end up with solutions that do not actually work in the equation.
This will only happen if the index on the root is even, and it will not happen all
the time. So for these problems it will be required that we check our answer in
the original problem. If a value does not work it is called an extraneous solution
and not included in the ﬁnal solution.
When solving a radical problem with an even index: check answers!
Example 442.
7x + 2
√
= 4
Even index! We will have to check answers
(
√7x + 2
)2 = 42
Square both sides, simplify exponents
7x + 2 = 16
Solve
− 2 − 2
Subtract 2 from both sides
7x = 14
Divide both sides by 7

Our Solution
Example 443.
3√x − 1
= − 4
Odd index, we don′t need to check answer
(
3√x − 1
)3 = ( − 4)3
Cube both sides, simplify exponents
x − 1 = − 64
Solve

x = − 63
Our Solution
Example 444.
4√3x + 6
= − 3
Even index! We will have to check answers
(
4√3x + 6
) = ( − 3)4
Rise both sides to fourth power
3x + 6 = 81
Solve
− 6 − 6
Subtract 6 from both sides
3x = 75
Divide both sides by 3

Take root

False, extraneous solution
No Solution
Our Solution
If the radical is not alone on one side of the equation we will have to solve for the
radical before we raise it to an exponent
Example 445.
x +
√4x + 1
= 5
Even index! We will have to check solutions
− x
− x
Isolate radical by subtracting x from both sides
√4x + 1
= 5 − x
Square both sides
(
√4x + 1
)2 = (5 − x)2
Evaluate exponents, recal (a − b)2 = a2 − 2ab + b2
4x + 1 = 25 − 10x + x2
Re − order terms
4x + 1 = x2 − 10x + 25
Make equation equal zero
− 4x − 1
− 4x − 1
Subtract 4x and 1 from both sides
0 = x2 − 14x + 24
Factor
0 = (x − 12)(x − 2)
Set each factor equal to zero
x − 12 = 0 or x − 2 = 0
Solve each equation
+ 12 + 12

x = 12 or x = 2

True! It works
x = 2
Our Solution
The above example illustrates that as we solve we could end up with an x2 term
or a quadratic. In this case we remember to set the equation to zero and solve by
factoring. We will have to check both solutions if the index in the problem was
even. Sometimes both values work, sometimes only one, and sometimes neither
works.
World View Note: The babylonians were the ﬁrst known culture to solve
quadratics in radicals - as early as 2000 BC!
If there is more than one square root in a problem we will clear the roots one at a
time. This means we must ﬁrst isolate one of them before we square both sides.

Our Solution
When there is more than one square root in the problem, after isolating one root
and squaring both sides we may still have a root remaining in the problem. In
this case we will again isolate the term with the second root and square both
sides. When isolating, we will isolate the term with the square root. This means
the square root can be multiplied by a number after isolating.

Quadratics - Solving with Exponents
Objective: Solve equations with exponents using the odd root property
and the even root property.
Another type of equation we can solve is one with exponents. As you might
expect we can clear exponents by using roots. This is done with very few unex-
pected results when the exponent is odd. We solve these problems very straight
forward using the odd root property
Odd Root Property: if an = b, then a =
b
n√
when n is odd
Example 449.
x5 = 32
Use odd root property
x5
5√
=
32
5√
Simplify roots
x = 2
Our Solution
However, when the exponent is even we will have two results from taking an even
root of both sides. One will be positive and one will be negative. This is because
both 32 = 9 and ( − 3)2 = 9. so when solving x2 = 9 we will have two solutions, one
positive and one negative: x = 3 and − 3
Even Root Property: if an = b, then a = ±
b
n√
when n is even
Example 450.
x4 = 16
Use even root property ( ± )

4√

Simplify roots
x = ± 2
Our Solution
World View Note: In 1545, French Mathematicain Gerolamo Cardano pub-
lished his book The Great Art, or the Rules of Algebra which included the solu-
tion of an equation with a fourth power, but it was considered absurd by many to
take a quantity to the fourth power because there are only three dimensions!
Example 451.
(2x + 4)2 = 36
Use even root property ( ± )
(2x + 4)2
�
= ±
36
√
Simplify roots
2x + 4 = ± 6
To avoid sign errors we need two equations
2x + 4 = 6 or 2x + 4 = − 6
One equation for + , one equation for −
− 4 − 4
− 4
− 4
Subtract 4 from both sides
2x = 2 or 2x = − 10
Divide both sides by 2
2
2
2
2
x = 1 or x = − 5
Our Solutions
In the previous example we needed two equations to simplify because when we
took the root, our solutions were two rational numbers, 6 and − 6. If the roots did
not simplify to rational numbers we can keep the ± in the equation.
Example 452.
(6x − 9)2 = 45
Use even root property ( ± )
(6x − 9)2
�
= ±
45
√
Simplify roots
6x − 9 = ± 3

√
Use one equation because root did not simplify to rational

Add 9 to both sides
6x = 9 ± 3

exponent before taking any roots.

(x + 4)3 = 125

Our Solution
Example 454.
(6x + 1)2 + 6 = 10
Isolate part with exponent
− 6 − 6
Subtract 6 from both sides
(6x + 1)2 = 4
Use even root property ( ± )
(6x + 1)2
�
= ±
4
√
Simplify roots
6x + 1 = ± 2
To avoid sign errors, we need two equations
6x + 1 = 2 or 6x + 1 = − 2
Solve each equation
− 1 − 1
− 1
− 1
Subtract 1 from both sides
6x = 1 or 6x = − 3
Divide both sides by 6

Our Solution
When our exponents are a fraction we will need to ﬁrst convert the fractional
exponent into a radical expression to solve. Recall that a
m
n = (
a
n√ )
m. Once we
have done this we can clear the exponent using either the even ( ± ) or odd root
property. Then we can clear the radical by raising both sides to an exponent
(remember to check answers if the index is even).
Example 455.
(4x + 1)

True! It works
x = 86
Our Solution
With rational exponents it is very helpful to convert to radical form to be able to
see if we need a ± because we used the even root property, or to see if we need
to check our answer because there was an even root in the problem. When
checking we will usually want to check in the radical form as it will be easier to
evaluate.

Quadratics - Complete the Square
Objective: Solve quadratic equations by completing the square.
When solving quadratic equations in the past we have used factoring to solve for
our variable. This is exactly what is done in the next example.
Example 457.
x2 + 5x + 6 = 0
Factor
(x + 3)(x + 2) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
x + 3 = 0
or
x + 2 = 0
Solve each equation
− 3 − 3
− 2 − 2
x = − 3
or
x = − 2
Our Solutions
However, the problem with factoring is all equations cannot be factored. Consider
the following equation: x2 − 2x − 7 = 0. The equation cannot be factored, however
there are two solutions to this equation, 1 + 2
2
√
and 1 − 2
2
√
. To ﬁnd these two
solutions we will use a method known as completing the square. When completing
the square we will change the quadratic into a perfect square which can easily be
solved with the square root property. The next example reviews the square root
property.
Example 458.

To complete the square, or make our problem into the form of the previous
example, we will be searching for the third term in a trinomial. If a quadratic is
of the form x2 + bx + c, and a perfect square, the third term, c, can be easily
found by the formula
�
1
2 · b
�2
. This is shown in the following examples, where we
ﬁnd the number that completes the square and then factor the perfect square.
Example 459.
x2 + 8x + c
c =

2 · b

The process in the previous examples, combined with the even root property, is
used to solve quadratic equations by completing the square. The following ﬁve
steps describe the process used to complete the square, along with an example to
demonstrate each step.

World View Note: The Chinese in 200 BC were the ﬁrst known culture group
to use a method similar to completing the square, but their method was only used
to calculate positive roots.
The advantage of this method is it can be used to solve any quadratic equation.
The following examples show how completing the square can give us rational solu-
tions, irrational solutions, and even complex solutions.

This solution is a very important one to us. As we solved a general equation by

and we will get our two solutions. This formula is

World View Note: Indian mathematician Brahmagupta gave the ﬁrst explicit
formula for solving quadratics in 628. However, at that time mathematics was not
done with variables and symbols, so the formula he gave was, “To the absolute
number multiplied by four times the square, add the square of the middle term;
the square root of the same, less the middle term, being divided by twice the
square
is
the
value.”
This
would

We can use the quadratic formula to solve any quadratic, this is shown in the fol-
lowing examples.

If a term is missing from the quadratic, we can still solve with the quadratic for-

for solving a problem.

Quadratics - Build Quadratics From Roots
Objective: Find a quadratic equation that has given roots using reverse
factoring and reverse completing the square.
Up to this point we have found the solutions to quadratics by a method such as
factoring or completing the square. Here we will take our solutions and work
backwards to ﬁnd what quadratic goes with the solutions.
We will start with rational solutions. If we have rational solutions we can use fac-
toring in reverse, we will set each solution equal to x and then make the equation
equal to zero by adding or subtracting. Once we have done this our expressions
will become the factors of the quadratic.
Example 471.
The solutions are 4 and − 2
Set each solution equal to x
x = 4 or x = − 2
Make each equation equal zero
− 4 − 4
+ 2
+ 2
Subtract 4 from ﬁrst, add 2 to second
x − 4 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
These expressions are the factors
(x − 4)(x + 2) = 0
FOIL
x2 + 2x − 4x − 8
Combine like terms
x2 − 2x − 8 = 0
Our Solution
If one or both of the solutions are fractions we will clear the fractions by multi-
plying by the denominators.
Example 472.
The solution are 2
3 and 3
4
Set each solution equal to x
x = 2
3 or x = 3
4
Clear fractions by multiplying by denominators
3x = 2 or 4x = 3
Make each equation equal zero
− 2 − 2
− 3 − 3
Subtract 2 from the ﬁrst, subtract 3 from the second
3x − 2 = 0 or 4x − 3 = 0
These expressions are the factors
(3x − 2)(4x − 3) = 0
FOIL
12x2 − 9x − 8x + 6 = 0
Combine like terms
348
12x2 − 17x + 6 = 0
Our Solution
If the solutions have radicals (or complex numbers) then we cannot use reverse
factoring. In these cases we will use reverse completing the square. When there
are radicals the solutions will always come in pairs, one with a plus, one with a
minus, that can be combined into “one” solution using ± . We will then set this
solution equal to x and square both sides. This will clear the radical from our
problem.
Example 473.
The solutions are
3
√
and −
3
√
Write as ′′one′′ expression equal to x
x = ±
3
√
Square both sides
x2 = 3
Make equal to zero
− 3 − 3
Subtract 3 from both sides
x2 − 3 = 0
Our Solution
We may have to isolate the term with the square root (with plus or minus) by
adding or subtracting. With these problems, remember to square a binomial we
use the formula (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
Example 474.
The solutions are 2 − 5
2
√
and 2 + 5
2
√
Write as ′′one′′ expression equal to x
x = 2 ± 5
2
√
Isolate the square root term

Subtract 2 from both sides
x − 2 = ± 5
2
√
Square both sides
x2 − 4x + 4 = 25 · 2
x2 − 4x + 4 = 50
Make equal to zero
− 50 − 50
Subtract 50
x2 − 4x − 46 = 0
Our Solution
World View Note: Before the quadratic formula, before completing the square,
before factoring, quadratics were solved geometrically by the Greeks as early as
300 BC! In 1079 Omar Khayyam, a Persian mathematician solved cubic equations
geometrically!
If the solution is a fraction we will clear it just as before by multiplying by the
denominator.

The process used for complex solutions is identical to the process used for radi-
cals.
Example 476.
The solutions are 4 − 5i and 4 + 5i
Write as ′′one′′ expression equal to x
x = 4 ± 5i
Isolate the i term
− 4 − 4
Subtract 4 from both sides
x − 4 = ± 5i
Square both sides
x2 − 8x + 16 = 25i2
i2 = − 1
x2 − 8x + 16 = − 25
Make equal to zero
+ 25
+ 25
Add 25 to both sides
x2 − 8x + 41 = 0

Write as ′′one′′ expression equal to x
x = 3 ± 5i

Clear fraction by multiplying by denominator
2x = 3 ± 5i
Isolate the i term
− 3 − 3
Subtract 3 from both sides
2x − 3 = ± 5i
Square both sides
4x2 − 12x + 9 = 5i2
i2 = − 1
4x2 − 12x + 9 = − 25
Make equal to zero

Quadratics - Quadratic in Form
Objective: Solve equations that are quadratic in form by substitution
to create a quadratic equation.
We have seen three diﬀerent ways to solve quadratics: factoring, completing the
square, and the quadratic formula. A quadratic is any equation of the form 0 =
ax2 + bx + c, however, we can use the skills learned to solve quadratics to solve
problems with higher (or sometimes lower) powers if the equation is in what is
called quadratic form.
Quadratic Form: 0 = axm+ bxn + c where m = 2n
An equation is in quadratic form if one of the exponents on a variable is double
the exponent on the same variable somewhere else in the equation. If this is the
case we can create a new variable, set it equal to the variable with smallest expo-
nent. When we substitute this into the equation we will have a quadratic equa-
tion we can solve.
World View Note: Arab mathematicians around the year 1000 were the ﬁrst to
use this method!
Example 478.
x4 − 13x2 + 36 = 0
Quadratic form, one exponent, 4, double the other, 2
y = x2

Quadratics - Rectangles
Objective: Solve applications of quadratic equations using rectangles.
An application of solving quadratic equations comes from the formula for the area
of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the width
by the length. To solve problems with rectangles we will ﬁrst draw a picture to
represent the problem and use the picture to set up our equation.
Example 484.
The length of a rectangle is 3 more than the width. If the area is 40 square
inches, what are the dimensions?
40
x
We do not know the width, x.
x + 3
Length is 4 more, or x + 4, and area is 40.
357
x(x + 3) = 40
Multiply length by width to get area
x2 + 3x = 40
Distribute
− 40 − 40
Make equation equal zero
x2 + 3x − 40 = 0
Factor
(x − 5)(x + 8) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
x − 5 = 0 or x + 8 = 0
Solve each equation
+ 5 + 5
− 8 − 8
x = 5 or x = − 8
Our x is a width, cannot be negative.
(5) + 3 = 8
Length is x + 3, substitute 5 for x to ﬁnd length
5 in by 8in
Our Solution
The above rectangle problem is very simple as there is only one rectangle
involved. When we compare two rectangles, we may have to get a bit more cre-
ative.
Example 485.
If each side of a square is increased by 6, the area is multiplied by 16. Find the
side of the original square.
x2 x
Square has all sides the same length
x
Area is found by multiplying length by width
16x2
x + 6
Each side is increased by 6,
x + 6
Area is 16 times original area
(x + 6)(x + 6) = 16x2
Multiply length by width to get area
x2 + 12x + 36 = 16x2
FOIL
− 16x2
− 16x2
Make equation equal zero
− 15x2 + 12x + 36 = 0
Divide each term by − 1, changes the signs
15x2 − 12x − 36 = 0

Our Solution
Example 486.
The length of a rectangle is 4 ft greater than the width. If each dimension is
increased by 3, the new area will be 33 square feet larger. Find the dimensions of
the original rectangle.
x(x + 4)
x
We don′t know width, x, length is 4 more, x + 4
x + 4
Area is found by multiplying length by width
x(x + 4) + 33
x + 3
Increase each side by 3.
width becomes x + 3, length x + 4 + 3 = x + 7
x + 7
Area is 33 more than original, x(x + 4) + 33
(x + 3)(x + 7) = x(x + 4) + 33
Set up equation, length times width is area
x2 + 10x + 21 = x2 + 4x + 33
Subtract x2 from both sides
− x2
− x2
10x + 21 = 4x + 33
Move variables to one side
− 4x
− 4x
Subtract 4x from each side
6x + 21 = 33
Subtract 21 from both sides
− 21 − 21
6x = 12
Divide both sides by 6
6
6
x = 2
x is the width of the original
(2) + 4 = 6
x + 4 is the length. Substitute 2 to ﬁnd
2 ft by 6ft
Our Solution
From one rectangle we can ﬁnd two equations. Perimeter is found by adding all
the sides of a polygon together. A rectangle has two widths and two lengths, both
the same size. So we can use the equation P = 2l + 2w (twice the length plus
twice the width).
Example 487.
The area of a rectangle is 168 cm2. The perimeter of the same rectangle is 52 cm.
What are the dimensions of the rectangle?
x
We don′t know anything about length or width
y
Use two variables, x and y
xy = 168
Length times width gives the area.
2x + 2y = 52
Also use perimeter formula.
− 2x

Solve by substitution, isolate y
2y = − 2x + 52
Divide each term by 2

y = − x + 26
Substitute into area equation
x( − x + 26) = 168
Distribute
− x2 + 26x = 168
Divide each term by − 1, changing all the signs
x2 − 26x = − 168
Solve by completing the square.

Find number to complete the square:

x2 − 26x + 324 = 1
Add 169 to both sides
(x − 13)2 = 1
Factor
x − 13 = ± 1
Square root both sides
+ 13 + 13
x = 13 ± 1
Evaluate
x = 14 or 12
Two options for ﬁrst side.
y = − (14) + 26 = 12
Substitute 14 into y = − x + 26
y = − (12) + 26 = 14
Substitute 12 into y = − x + 26
Both are the same rectangle, variables switched!

World View Note: Indian mathematical records from the 9th century demon-
strate that their civilization had worked extensivly in geometry creating religious
alters of various shapes including rectangles.
Another type of rectangle problem is what we will call a “frame problem”. The
idea behind a frame problem is that a rectangle, such as a photograph, is centered
inside another rectangle, such as a frame. In these cases it will be important to
rememember that the frame extends on all sides of the rectangle. This is shown in
the following example.
Example 488.
An 8 in by 12 in picture has a frame of uniform width around it. The area of the
frame is equal to the area of the picture. What is the width of the frame?
8
12 12 + 2x
Draw picture, picture if 8 by 10
If frame has width x, on both sides, we add 2x
8 + 2x
8 · 12 = 96
Area of the picture, length times width
2 · 96 = 192
Frameisthesameasthepicture.Totalareaisdoublethis.
(12 + 2x)(8 + 2x) = 192
Area of everything, length times width
96 + 24x + 16x + 4x2 = 192
FOIL
4x2 + 40x + 96 = 192
Combine like terms

Make equation equal to zero by subtracting 192
4x2 + 40x − 96 = 0

Example 489.
A farmer has a ﬁeld that is 400 rods by 200 rods. He is mowing the ﬁeld in a
spiral pattern, starting from the outside and working in towards the center. After
an hour of work, 72% of the ﬁeld is left uncut. What is the size of the ring cut
around the outside?
400 − 2x
200 − 2x
200
Draw picture, outside is 200 by 400
If frame has width x on both sides,
subtract 2x from each side to get center
400
400 · 200 = 80000
Area of entire ﬁeld, length times width
80000 · (0.72) = 57600
Area of center, multiply by 28% as decimal
(400 − 2x)(200 − 2x) = 57600
Area of center, length times width
80000 − 800x − 400x + 4x2 = 57600
FOIL
4x2 − 1200x + 80000 = 57600
Combine like terms
− 57600 − 57600
Make equation equal zero
4x2 − 1200x + 22400 = 0
Factor out GCF of 4
4(x2 − 300x + 5600) = 0
Factor trinomial
4(x − 280)(x − 20) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
x − 280 = 0
or
x − 20 = 0
Solve each equation
+ 280 + 280
+ 20 + 20
x = 280 or 20
The ﬁeld is only 200 rods wide,
Can′t cut 280 oﬀ two sides!
20 rods
Our Solution
For each of the frame problems above we could have also completed the square or
use the quadratic formula to solve the trinomials. Remember that completing the
square or the quadratic formula always will work when solving, however, factoring
only works if we can factor the trinomial.

Quadratics - Teamwork
Objective: Solve teamwork problems by creating a rational equation to
model the problem.
If it takes one person 4 hours to paint a room and another person 12 hours to
paint the same room, working together they could paint the room even quicker, it
turns out they would paint the room in 3 hours together. This can be reasoned by
the following logic, if the ﬁrst person paints the room in 4 hours, she paints 1
4 of
the room each hour. If the second person takes 12 hours to paint the room, he
paints
1
12 of the room each hour. So together, each hour they paint 1

hour, it follows that it will take 3 hours to complete the entire room.
This pattern is used to solve teamwork problems. If the ﬁrst person does a job in
A, a second person does a job in B, and together they can do a job in T (total).
We can use the team work equation.
Teamwork Equation: 1
A + 1
B = 1
T
Often these problems will involve fractions. Rather than thinking of the ﬁrst frac-
tion as 1
A, it may be better to think of it as the reciprocal of A’s time.
World View Note: When the Egyptians, who were the ﬁrst to work with frac-
tions, wrote fractions, they were all unit fractions (numerator of one). They only
used these type of fractions for about 2000 years! Some believe that this cumber-
some style of using fractions was used for so long out of tradition, others believe
the Egyptians had a way of thinking about and working with fractions that has
been completely lost in history.
Example 490.
Adam can clean a room in 3 hours. If his sister Maria helps, they can clean it in
2 2
5 hours. How long will it take Maria to do the job alone?
22
5 = 12
5
Together time, 22
5, needs to be converted to fraction
Adan: 3, Maria: x, Total: 5
12
Clearly state times for each and total, using x for Maria
364

3 + 1
x = 5
12
Using reciprocals, add the individual times gives total
1(12x)
3
+ 1(12x)
x
= 5(12x)
12
Multiply each term by LCD of 12x
4x + 12 = 5x
Reduce each fraction
− 4x
− 4x
Move variables to one side, subtracting 4x
12 = x
Our solution for x
It takes Maria 12 hours
Our Solution
Somtimes we only know how two people’s times are related to eachother as in the
next example.
Example 491.
Mike takes twice as long as Rachel to complete a project. Together they can com-
plete the project in 10 hours. How long will it take each of them to complete the
project alone?
Mike: 2x, Rachel: x, Total: 10
Clearly deﬁne variables. If Rachel is x, Mike is 2x
1
2x + 1
x = 1
10
Using reciprocals, add individal times equaling total
1(10x)
2x
+ 1(10x)
x
= 1(10x)
10
Multiply each term by LCD, 10x
5 + 10 = x
Combine like terms
15 = x
We have our x, we said x was Rachel′s time
2(15) = 30
Mike is double Rachel, this gives Mike′s time.
Mike: 30 hr, Rachel: 15hr
Our Solution
With problems such as these we will often end up with a quadratic to solve.
Example 492.
Brittney can build a large shed in 10 days less than Cosmo can. If they built it
together it would take them 12 days. How long would it take each of them
working alone?
Britney: x − 10, Cosmo: x, Total: 12
If Cosmo is x, Britney is x − 10

x = 1

Using reciprocals, make equation
365
1(12x(x − 10))
x − 10
+ 1(12x(x − 10))
x
= 1(12x(x − 10))
12
Multiply by LCD: 12x(x − 10)
12x + 12(x − 10) = x(x − 10)
Reduce fraction
12x + 12x − 120 = x2 − 10x
Distribute
24x − 120 = x2 − 10x
Combine like terms
− 24x + 120 − 24x + 120
Move all terms to one side
0 = x2 − 34x + 120
Factor
0 = (x − 30)(x − 4)
Set each factor equal to zero
x − 30 = 0 or x − 4 = 0
Solve each equation
+ 30 + 30
+ 4 + 4
x = 30 or x = 4
This, x, was deﬁned as Cosmo.
30 − 10 = 20 or 4 − 10 = − 6
Find Britney, can′t have negative time
Britney: 20 days, Cosmo: 30 days
Our Solution
In the previous example, when solving, one of the possible times ended up nega-
tive. We can’t have a negative amount of time to build a shed, so this possibility
is ignored for this problem. Also, as we were solving, we had to factor x2 − 34x +
120. This may have been diﬃcult to factor. We could have also chosen to com-
plete the square or use the quadratic formula to ﬁnd our solutions.
It is important that units match as we solve problems. This means we may have
to convert minutes into hours to match the other units given in the problem.
Example 493.
An electrician can complete a job in one hour less than his apprentice. Together
they do the job in 1 hour and 12 minutes. How long would it take each of them

Very similar to a teamwork problem is when the two involved parts are working
against each other. A common example of this is a sink that is ﬁlled by a pipe
and emptied by a drain. If they are working against eachother we need to make
one of the values negative to show they oppose eachother. This is shown in the
next example..
Example 494.
A sink can be ﬁlled by a pipe in 5 minutes but it takes 7 minutes to drain a full
sink. If both the pipe and the drain are open, how long will it take to ﬁll the
sink?

Quadratics - Simultaneous Products
Objective: Solve simultaneous product equations using substitution to
create a rational equation.
When solving a system of equations where the variables are multiplied together
we can use the same idea of substitution that we used with linear equations.
When we do so we may end up with a quadratic equation to solve. When we used
substitution we solved for a variable and substitute this expression into the other
equation. If we have two products we will choose a variable to solve for ﬁrst and
divide both sides of the equations by that variable or the factor containing the
variable. This will create a situation where substitution can easily be done.
Example 495.
xy = 48
(x + 3)(y − 2) = 54
To solve for x, divide ﬁrst
equation by x, second by x + 3
y = 48
x
and y − 2 =

Substitute 48
x for y in the second equation

Reduce each fraction
48(x + 3) − 2x(x + 3) = 54x

− 54x
Subtract 54x from both sides
− 2x2 − 12x + 144 = 0
Divide each term by GCF of − 2
x2 + 6x − 72 = 0
Factor
(x − 6)(x + 12) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
x − 6 = 0 or x + 12 = 0

These simultaneous product equations will also solve by the exact same pattern.
We pick a variable to solve for, divide each side by that variable, or factor con-
taining the variable. This will allow us to use substitution to create a rational
expression we can use to solve. Quite often these problems will have two solu-
tions.

Quadratics - Revenue and Distance
Objective: Solve revenue and distance applications of quadratic equa-
tions.
A common application of quadratics comes from revenue and distance problems.
Both are set up almost identical to each other so they are both included together.
Once they are set up, we will solve them in exactly the same way we solved the
simultaneous product equations.
Revenue problems are problems where a person buys a certain number of items
for a certain price per item. If we multiply the number of items by the price per
item we will get the total paid. To help us organize our information we will use
the following table for revenue problems
Number Price Total
First
Second
The price column will be used for the individual prices, the total column is used
for the total paid, which is calculated by multiplying the number by the price.
Once we have the table ﬁlled out we will have our equations which we can solve.
This is shown in the following examples.
Example 497.
A man buys several ﬁsh for S56. After three ﬁsh die, he decides to sell the rest at
a proﬁt of S5 per ﬁsh. His total proﬁt was S4. How many ﬁsh did he buy to
begin with?
Number Price Total

Using our table, we don′t know the number

Our Solution
The above examples were solved by the quadratic formula and completing the
square. For either of these we could have used either method or even factoring.
Remember we have several options for solving quadratics. Use the one that seems
easiest for the problem.
Distance problems work with the same ideas that the revenue problems work.
The only diﬀerence is the variables are r and t (for rate and time), instead of
n and p (for number and price). We already know that distance is calculated by
multiplying rate by time. So for our distance problems our table becomes the fol-
lowing:
rate time distance
First
Second
Using this table and the exact same patterns as the revenue problems is shown in
the following example.
Example 499.

Greg went to a conference in a city 120 miles away. On the way back, due to road
construction he had to drive 10 mph slower which resulted in the return trip
taking 2 hours longer. How fast did he drive on the way to the conference?

Coming back he drove 10 mph slower (r − 10)
and took 2 hours longer (t + 2). The distance
was still 120 miles.
rt = 120
Equations are product of rate and time
(r − 10)(t + 2) = 120
We have simultaneous product equations
t = 120
r
and t + 2 =

Solving for rate, divide by r and r − 10

Our Solution
World View Note: The world’s fastest man (at the time of printing) is
Jamaican Usain Bolt who set the record of running 100 m in 9.58 seconds on
August 16, 2009 in Berlin. That is a speed of over 23 miles per hour!
Another type of simultaneous product distance problem is where a boat is trav-
eling in a river with the current or against the current (or an airplane ﬂying with
the wind or against the wind). If a boat is traveling downstream, the current will
push it or increase the rate by the speed of the current. If a boat is traveling
376
upstream, the current will pull against it or decrease the rate by the speed of the
current. This is demonstrated in the following example.
Example 500.
A man rows down stream for 30 miles then turns around and returns to his orig-
inal location, the total trip took 8 hours. If the current ﬂows at 2 miles per hour,
how fast would the man row in still water?

We know the distance up and down is 30.
Put t for time downstream. Subtracting

Downstream the current of 2 mph pushes
the boat (r + 2) and upstream the current
pulls the boat (r − 2)
(r + 2)t = 30
Multiply rate by time to get equations
(r − 2)(8 − t) = 30
We have a simultaneous product
t =
30
r + 2 and 8 − t =
30
r − 2
Solving for rate, divide by r + 2 or r − 2
8 −

r − 2
Substitute 30
r + 2 for t in second equation
8(r + 2)(r − 2) − 30(r + 2)(r − 2)
r + 2
= 30(r + 2)(r − 2)
r − 2
Multiply each term by LCD: (r + 2)(r − 2)
8(r + 2)(r − 2) − 30(r − 2) = 30(r + 2)
Reduce fractions
8r2 − 32 − 30r + 60 = 30r + 60
Multiply and distribute
8r2 − 30r + 28 = 30r + 60
Make equation equal zero
− 30r − 60 − 30r − 60
8r2 − 60r − 32 = 0
Divide each term by 4
2r2 − 15r − 8 = 0
Factor
(2r + 1)(r − 8) = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
2r + 1 = 0 or r − 8 = 0
Solve each equation

Quadratics - Graphs of Quadratics
Objective: Graph quadratic equations using the vertex, x-intercepts,
and y-intercept.
Just as we drew pictures of the solutions for lines or linear equations, we can draw
a picture of solution to quadratics as well. One way we can do that is to make a
table of values.
Example 501.
y = x2 − 4x + 3
Make a table of values
x y

We will test 5 values to get an idea of shape
y = (0)2 + 4(0) + 3 = 0 − 0 + 3 = 3
Plug 0 in for x and evaluate
y = (1)2 − 4(1) + 3 = 1 − 4 + 3 = 0
Plug 1 in for x and evaluate
y = (2)2 − 4(2) + 3 = 4 − 8 + 3 = − 1
Plug 2 in for x and evaluate
y = (3)2 − 4(3) + 3 = 9 − 12 + 3 = 0
Plug 3 in for x and evaluate
y = (4)2 − 4(4) + 3 = 16 − 16 + 3 = 3

Plot the points (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, − 1),
(3, 0), and (4, 3).
Connect
the
dots
with
a
smooth
curve.
Our Solution
When we have x2 in our equations, the graph will no longer be a straight line.
Quadratics have a graph that looks like a U shape that is called a parabola.
World View Note: The ﬁrst major female mathematician was Hypatia of Egypt
who was born around 370 AD. She studied conic sections. The parabola is one
type of conic section.
380
The above method to graph a parabola works for any equation, however, it can be
very tedious to ﬁnd all the correct points to get the correct bend and shape. For
this reason we identify several key points on a graph and in the equation to help
us graph parabolas more eﬃciently. These key points are described below.
A
B
C
D
Point A: y-intercept: Where the graph
crosses the vertical y-axis.
Points B and C: x-intercepts: Where
the graph crosses the horizontal x-axis
Point D: Vertex: The point where the
graph curves and changes directions.
We will use the following method to ﬁnd each of the points on our parabola.
To graph the equation y = ax2 + bx + c, ﬁnd the following points
1. y-intercept: Found by making x = 0, this simpliﬁes down to y = c
2. x-intercepts: Found by making y = 0, this means solving 0 = ax2 + bx + c
3. Vertex: Let x = − b
2a to ﬁnd x. Then plug this value into the equation to ﬁnd
y.
After ﬁnding these points we can connect the dots with a smooth curve to ﬁnd
our graph!
Example 502.
y = x2 + 4x + 3
Find the key points
y = 3
y = c is the y − intercept
0 = x2 + 4x + 3
To ﬁnd x − intercept we solve the equation
0 = (x + 3)(x + 1)
Factor
x + 3 = 0 and x + 1 = 0
Set each factor equal to zero
− 3 − 3
− 1 − 1
Solve each equation
x = − 3 and x = − 1
Our x − intercepts
x = − 4
2(1) = − 4
2 = − 2
To ﬁnd the vertex, ﬁrst use x = − b
2a
y = ( − 2)2 + 4( − 2) + 3
Plug this answer into equation to ﬁnd y − coordinate
y = 4 − 8 + 3
Evaluate
y = − 1
The y − coordinate
( − 2, − 1)
Vertex as a point
381
Graph the y-intercept at 3, the x-
intercepts at
− 3 and − 1, and the
vertex at ( − 2, − 1). Connect the dots
with a smooth curve in a U shape to
get our parabola.
Our Solution
If the a in y = ax2 + bx + c is a negative value, the parabola will end up being an
upside-down U. The process to graph it is identical, we just need to be very
careful of how our signs operate. Remember, if a is negative, then ax2 will also be
negative because we only square the x, not the a.
Example 503.
y = − 3x2 + 12x − 9
Find key points
y = − 9
y − intercept is y = c
0 = − 3x2 + 12x − 9
To ﬁnd x − intercept solve this equation
0 = − 3(x2 − 4x + 3)
Factor out GCF ﬁrst, then factor rest
0 = − 3(x − 3)(x − 1)
Set each factor with a varaible equal to zero
x − 3 = 0 and x − 1 = 0
Solve each equation
+ 3 + 3
+ 1 + 1
x = 3 and x = 1
Our x − intercepts
x = − 12
2( − 3) = − 12
− 6 = 2
To ﬁnd the vertex, ﬁrst use x = − b
2a
y = − 3(2)2 + 12(2) − 9
Plug this value into equation to ﬁnd y − coordinate
y = − 3(4) + 24 − 9
Evaluate
y = − 12 + 24 − 9
y = 3
y − value of vertex
(2, 3)
Vertex as a point
Graph the y-intercept at
− 9, the x-
intercepts at 3 and 1, and the vertex at
(2, 3). Connect the dots with smooth
curve in an upside-down U shape to
get our parabola.
Our Solution
382
It is important to remember the graph of all quadratics is a parabola with the
same U shape (they could be upside-down). If you plot your points and we cannot
connect them in the correct U shape then one of your points must be wrong. Go
back and check your work to be sure they are correct!
Just as all quadratics (equation with y = x2) all have the same U-shape to them
and all linear equations (equations such as y = x) have the same line shape when
graphed, diﬀerent equations have diﬀerent shapes to them. Below are some
common equations (some we have yet to cover!) with their graph shape drawn.

Functions - Function Notation
Objective: Idenﬁty functions and use correct notation to evaluate func-
tions at numerical and variable values.
There are many diﬀerent types of equations that we can work with in algebra. An
equation gives the relationship between variables and numbers. Examples of sev-
eral relationships are below:
(x − 3)2
9
− (y + 2)2
4
= 1
and
y = x2 − 2x + 7
and
√y + x
− 7 = xy
There is a speical classiﬁcation of relationships known as functions. Functions
have at most one output for any input. Generally x is the variable that we plug
into an equation and evaluate to ﬁnd y. For this reason x is considered an input
variable and y is considered an output variable. This means the deﬁnition of a
function, in terms of equations in x and y could be said, for any x value there is at
most one y value that corresponds with it.
A great way to visualize this deﬁnition is to look at the graphs of a few relation-
ships. Because x values are vertical lines we will draw a vertical line through the
graph. If the vertical line crosses the graph more than once, that means we have
too many possible y values. If the graph crosses the graph only once, then we say
the relationship is a function.
386
Example 504.
Which of the following graphs are graphs of functions?
Drawing a vertical line
through this graph will
only
cross
the
graph
once, it is a function.
Drawing a vertical line
through this graph will
cross the graph twice,
once at top and once at
bottom. This is not a
function.
Drawing a vertical line
through this graph will
cross
the
graph
only
once, it is a function.
We can look at the above idea in an algebraic method by taking a relationship
and solving it for y. If we have only one solution then it is a function.
Example 505.
Is 3x2 − y = 5 a function?
Solve the relation for y
− 3x2 − 3x2
Subtract 3x2 from both sides
− y = − 3x2 + 5
Divide each term by − 1
− 1
− 1 − 1
y = 3x2 − 5
Only one solution for y.
Yes!
It is a function
Example 506.
Is y2 − x = 5 a function?
Solve the relation for y
+ x + x
Add x to both sides
y2 = x + 5
Square root of both sdies
y2
�
= ±
x + 5
√
Simplify
y = ±
√x + 5
Two solutions for y(one + , one − )
No!
Not a function
Once we know we have a function, often we will change the notation used to
emphasis the fact that it is a function. Instead of writing y = , we will use func-
tion notation which can be written f(x) = . We read this notation “f of x”. So for
387
the above example that was a function, instead of writing y = 3x2 − 5, we could
have written f(x) = 3x2 − 5. It is important to point out that f(x) does not mean
f times x, it is mearly a notation that names the function with the ﬁrst letter
(function f) and then in parenthesis we are given information about what vari-
ables are in the function (variable x). The ﬁrst letter can be anything we want it
to be, often you will see g(x) (read g of x).
World View Note: The concept of a function was ﬁrst introduced by Arab
mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi in the late 12th century
Once we know a relationship is a function, we may be interested in what values
can be put into the equations. The values that are put into an equation (generally
the x values) are called the domain. When ﬁnding the domain, often it is easier
to consider what cannot happen in a given function, then exclude those values.
Example 507.
Find the domain: f(x) =
3x − 1
x2 + x − 6
With fractions, zero can′t be in denominator
x2 + x − 6
� 0
Solve by factoring
(x + 3)(x − 2)
� 0
Set each factor not equal to zero
x + 3
� 0 and x − 2
� 0
Solve each equation
− 3 − 3
+ 2 + 2
x
� − 3, 2
Our Solution
The notation in the previous example tells us that x can be any value except for
− 3 and 2. If x were one of those two values, the function would be undeﬁned.
Example 508.
Find the domain: f(x) = 3x2 − x
With this equation there are no bad values
All Real Numbers or R
Our Solution
In the above example there are no real numbers that make the function unde-
ﬁned. This means any number can be used for x.
Example 509.
Find the domain: f(x) =
2x − 3
√
Square roots can′t be negative
388
2x − 3 ⩾ 0
Set up an inequality
+ 3 + 3
Solve
2x ⩾ 3
2
2
x ⩾ 3
2
Our Solution
The notation in the above example states that our variable can be
3
2 or any
number larger than
3
2. But any number smaller would make the function unde-
ﬁned (without using imaginary numbers).
Another use of function notation is to easily plug values into functions. If we want
to substitute a variable for a value (or an expression) we simply replace the vari-
able with what we want to plug in. This is shown in the following examples.
Example 510.
f(x) = 3x2 − 4x; ﬁnd f( − 2)
Substitute − 2 in for x in the function
f( − 2) = 3( − 2)2 − 4( − 2)
Evaluate, exponents ﬁrst
f( − 2) = 3(4) − 4( − 2)
Multiply
f( − 2) = 12 + 8
Add
f( − 2) = 20
Our Solution
Example 511.
h(x) = 32x−6; ﬁnd h(4)
Substitute 4 in for x in the function
h(4) = 32(4)−6
Simplify exponent, mutiplying ﬁrst
h(4) = 38−6
Subtract in exponent
h(4) = 32
Evaluate exponent
h(4) = 9
Our Solution
Example 512.
k(a) = 2|a + 4|; ﬁnd k( − 7)
Substitute − 7 in for a in the function
k( − 7) = 2| − 7 + 4|
Add inside absolute values
k( − 7) = 2| − 3|
Evaluate absolute value
k( − 7) = 2(3)
Multiply
389
k( − 7) = 6
Our Solution
As the above examples show, the function can take many diﬀerent forms, but the
pattern to evaluate the function is always the same, replace the variable with
what is in parenthesis and simplify. We can also substitute expressions into func-
tions using the same process. Often the expressions use the same variable, it is
important to remember each variable is replaced by whatever is in parenthesis.
Example 513.
g (x) = x4 + 1; ﬁnd g(3x)
Replace x in the function with (3x)
g(3x) = (3x)4 + 1
Simplify exponet
g(3x) = 81x4 + 1
Our Solution
Example 514.
p(t) = t2 − t; ﬁnd p(t + 1)
Replace each t in p(t) with (t + 1)
p(t + 1) = (t + 1)2 − (t + 1)
Square binomial
p(t + 1) = t2 + 2t + 1 − (t + 1)
Distribute negative
p(t + 1) = t2 + 2t + 1 − t − 1
Combine like terms
p(t + 1) = t2 + t
Our Solution
It is important to become comfortable with function notation and how to use it as
we transition into more advanced algebra topics.

Functions - Operations on Functions
Objective: Combine functions using sum, diﬀerence, product, quotient
and composition of functions.
Several functions can work together in one larger function. There are 5 common
operations that can be performed on functions. The four basic operations on func-
tions are adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. The notation for these
functions is as follows.
Addition
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
Subtraction
(f − g)(x) = f(x) − g(x)
Multiplication
(f · g)(x) = f(x)g(x)
Division
� f
g
�
(x) = f(x)
g(x)
When we do one of these four basic operations we can simply evaluate the two
functions at the value and then do the operation with both solutions
Example 515.
f(x) = x2 − x − 2
g(x) = x + 1
ﬁnd (f + g)( − 3)
Evaluate f and g at − 3
f( − 3) = ( − 3)2 − ( − 3) − 2
Evaluate f at − 3
f( − 3) = 9 + 3 − 2
f( − 3) = 10
g( − 3) = ( − 3) + 1
Evaluate g at − 3
g( − 3) = − 2
f( − 3) + g( − 3)
Add the two functions together
(10) + ( − 2)
Add
8
Our Solution
The process is the same regardless of the operation being performed.
Example 516.
h(x) = 2x − 4
k(x) = − 3x + 1
Find (h· k)(5)
Evaluate h and k at 5
h(5) = 2(5) − 4
Evaluate h at 5
393
h(5) = 10 − 4
h(5) = 6
k(5) = − 3(5) + 1
Evaluate k at 5
k(5) = − 15 + 1
k(5) = − 14
h(5)k(5)
Multiply the two results together
(6)( − 14)
Multiply
− 84
Our Solution
Often as we add, subtract, multiply, or divide functions, we do so in a way that
keeps the variable. If there is no number to plug into the equations we will simply
use each equation, in parenthesis, and simplify the expression.
Example 517.
f(x) = 2x − 4
g(x) = x2 − x + 5
Write subtraction problem of functions
Find (f − g)(x)
f(x) − g(x)
Replace f(x) with (2x − 3) and g(x) with (x2 − x + 5)
(2x − 4) − (x2 − x + 5)
Distribute the negative
2x − 4 − x2 + x − 5
Combine like terms
− x2 + 3x − 9
Our Solution
The parenthesis are very important when we are replacing f(x) and g(x) with a
variable. In the previous example we needed the parenthesis to know to distribute
the negative.
Example 518.
f(x) = x2 − 4x − 5
g(x) = x − 5
Find
� f
g
�
(x)
Write division problem of functions
f(x)
g(x)
Replace f(x) with (x2 − 4x − 5) and g(x) with (x − 5)
(x2 − 4x − 5)
(x − 5)
To simplify the fraction we must ﬁrst factor
394
(x − 5)(x + 1)
(x − 5)
Divide out common factor of x − 5
x + 1
Our Solution
Just as we could substitute an expression into evaluating functions, we can substi-
tute an expression into the operations on functions.
Example 519.
f(x) = 2x − 1
g(x) = x + 4
Write as a sum of functions
Find (f + g)(x2)
f(x2) + g(x2)
Replace x in f(x) and g(x) with x2
[2(x2) − 1] + [(x2) + 4]
Distribute the + does not change the problem
2x2 − 1 + x2 + 4
Combine like terms
3x2 + 3
Our Solution
Example 520.
f(x) = 2x − 1
g(x) = x + 4
Write as a product of functions
Find (f · g)(3x)
f(3x)g(3x)
Replace x in f(x) and g(x) with 3x
[2(3x) − 1][(3x) + 4]
Multiply our 2(3x)
(6x − 1)(3x + 4)
FOIL
18x2 + 24x − 3x − 4
Combine like terms
18x2 + 21x − 4
Our Solution
The ﬁfth operation of functions is called composition of functions. A composition
of functions is a function inside of a function. The notation used for composition
of functions is:
(f ◦ g)(x) = f(g(x))
To calculate a composition of function we will evaluate the inner function and
substitute the answer into the outer function. This is shown in the following
example.
395
Example 521.
a(x) = x2 − 2x + 1
b(x) = x − 5
Rewrite as a function in function
Find (a ◦ b)(3)
a(b(3))
Evaluate the inner function ﬁrst, b(3)
b(3) = (3) − 5 = − 2
This solution is put into a, a( − 2)
a( − 2) = ( − 2)2 − 2( − 2) + 1
Evaluate
a( − 2) = 4 + 4 + 1
Add
a( − 2) = 9
Our Solution
396
We can also evaluate a composition of functions at a variable. In these problems
we will take the inside function and substitute into the outside function.
Example 522.
f(x) = x2 − x
g(x) = x + 3
Find (f ◦ g)(x)
Rewrite as a function in function
f(g(x))
Replace g(x) with x + 3
f(x + 3)
Replace the variables in f with (x + 3)
(x + 3)2 − (x + 3)
Evaluate exponent
(x2 + 6x + 9) − (x + 3)
Distribute negative
x2 + 6x + 9 − x − 3
Combine like terms
x2 + 5x + 6
Our Solution
It is important to note that very rarely is (f ◦ g)(x) the same as (g ◦ f)(x) as the
following example will show, using the same equations, but compositing them in
the opposite direction.
Example 523.
f(x) = x2 − x
g(x) = x + 3
Find (g ◦ f)(x)
Rewrite as a function in function
g(f(x))
Replace f(x) with x2 − x
g(x2 − x)
Replace the variable in g with (x2 − x)
(x2 − x) + 3
Here the parenthesis don′t change the expression
x2 − x + 3
Our Solution
World View Note: The term “function” came from Gottfried Wihelm Leibniz, a
German mathematician from the late 17th century.

Functions - Inverse Functions
Objective: Identify and ﬁnd inverse functions.
When a value goes into a function it is called the input. The result that we get
when we evaluate the function is called the output. When working with functions
sometimes we will know the output and be interested in what input gave us the
output. To ﬁnd this we use an inverse function. As the name suggests an inverse
function undoes whatever the function did. If a function is named f(x), the
inverse function will be named f −1(x) (read “f inverse of x”). The negative one is
not an exponent, but mearly a symbol to let us know that this function is the
inverse of f.
World View Note: The notation used for functions was ﬁrst introduced by the
great Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler in the 18th century.
For example, if f(x) = x + 5, we could deduce that the inverse function would be
f −1(x) = x − 5. If we had an input of 3, we could calculate f(3) = (3) + 5 = 8. Our
output is 8. If we plug this output into the inverse function we get f −1(8) = (8) −
5 = 3, which is the original input.
Often the functions are much more involved than those described above. It may
be diﬃcult to determine just by looking at the functions if they are inverses. In
order to test if two functions, f(x) and g(x) are inverses we will calculate the
composition of the two functions at x. If f changes the variable x in some way,
then g undoes whatever f did, then we will be back at x again for our ﬁnal solu-
tion. In otherwords, if we simplify (f ◦ g)(x) the solution will be x. If it is any-
thing but x the functions are not inverses.

Our Solution
While the composition is useful to show two functions are inverses, a more
common problem is to ﬁnd the inverse of a function. If we think of x as our input
and y as our output from a function, then the inverse will take y as an input and
give x as the output. This means if we switch x and y in our function we will ﬁnd
the inverse! This process is called the switch and solve strategy.
Switch and solve strategy to ﬁnd an inverse:
1. Replace f(x) with y
2. Switch x and y’s
3. Solve for y
4. Replace y with f −1(x)
Example 527.
Find the inverse of f(x) = (x + 4)3 − 2
Replace f(x) with y
y = (x + 4)3 − 2
Switch x and y
x = (y + 4)3 − 2
Solve for y

Switch x and y
x = 2y − 3
4y + 2
Multiply by (4y + 2)
x(4y + 2) = 2y − 3
Distribute
4xy + 2x = 2y − 3
Move all y′s to one side, rest to other side
− 4xy + 3 − 4xy + 3
Subtract 4xy and add 3 to both sides
2x + 3 = 2y − 4xy
Factor out y
2x + 3 = y(2 − 4x)
Divide by 2 − 4x
2 − 4x
2 − 4x
2x + 3
2 − 4x = y
Replace y with g−1(x)
g−1(x) = 2x + 3
2 − 4x
Our Solution
In this lesson we looked at two diﬀerent things, ﬁrst showing functions are
inverses by calculating the composition, and second ﬁnding an inverse when we
only have one function. Be careful not to get them backwards. When we already
have two functions and are asked to show they are inverses, we do not want to use
the switch and solve strategy, what we want to do is calculate the inverse. There
may be several ways to represent the same function so the switch and solve
strategy may not look the way we expect and can lead us to conclude two func-
tions are not inverses when they are in fact inverses.

Functions - Exponential Functions
Objective: Solve exponential equations by ﬁnding a common base.
As our study of algebra gets more advanced we begin to study more involved
functions. One pair of inverse functions we will look at are exponential functions
and logarithmic functions. Here we will look at exponential functions and then we
will consider logarithmic functions in another lesson. Exponential functions are
functions where the variable is in the exponent such as f(x) = ax. (It is important
not to confuse exponential functions with polynomial functions where the variable
is in the base such as f(x) = x2).
World View Note One common application of exponential functions is popula-
tion growth. According to the 2009 CIA World Factbook, the country with the
highest population growth rate is a tie between the United Arab Emirates (north
of Saudi Arabia) and Burundi (central Africa) at 3.69%. There are 32 countries
with negative growth rates, the lowest being the Northern Mariana Islands (north
of Australia) at − 7.08%.
Solving exponetial equations cannot be done using the skill set we have seen in
the past. For example, if 3x = 9, we cannot take the x − root of 9 because we do
not know what the index is and this doesn’t get us any closer to ﬁnding x. How-
ever, we may notice that 9 is 32. We can then conclude that if 3x = 32 then x = 2.
This is the process we will use to solve exponential functions. If we can re-write a
problem so the bases match, then the exponents must also match.
Example 529.
52x+1 = 125
Rewrite 125 as 53
52x+1 = 53
Same base, set exponents equal
2x + 1 = 3
Solve
− 1 − 1
Subtract 1 from both sides
2x = 2
Divide both sides by 2
2
2
x = 1
Our Solution
Sometimes we may have to do work on both sides of the equation to get a
common base. As we do so, we will use various exponent properties to help. First
we will use the exponent property that states (ax)y = axy.
406
Example 530.
83x = 32
Rewrite 8 as 23 and 32 as 25
(23)3x = 25
Multiply exponents 3 and 3x
29x = 25
Same base, set exponents equal
9x = 5
Solve
9
9
Divide both sides by 9
x = 5
9
Our Solution
As we multiply exponents we may need to distribute if there are several terms
involved.
Example 531.
273x+5 = 814x+1
Rewrite 27 as 33 and 81 as 34 (92 would not be same base)
(33)3x+5 = (34)4x+1
Multiply exponents 3(3x + 5) and 4(4x + 1)
39x+15= 316x+4
Same base, set exponents equal
9x + 15 = 16x + 4
Move variables to one side
− 9x
− 9x
Subtract 9x from both sides
15 = 7x + 4
Subtract 4 from both sides
− 4
− 4
11 = 7x
Divide both sides by 7
7
7
11
7 = x
Our Solution
Another useful exponent property is that negative exponents will give us a recip-
rocal,
1
an = a−n
Example 532.
� 1
9
�2x
= 37x−1
Rewrite 1
9 as 3−2 (negative exponet to ﬂip)
(3−2)2x = 37x−1
Multiply exponents − 2 and 2x
3−4x = 37x−1
Same base, set exponets equal
− 4x = 7x − 1
Subtract 7x from both sides
− 7x − 7x
− 11x = − 1
Divide by − 11
− 11 − 11
x = 1
11
Our Solution
If we have several factors with the same base on one side of the equation we can
add the exponents using the property that states axay = ax+y.
407
Example 533.
54x · 52x−1 = 53x+11
Add exponents on left, combing like terms
56x−1 = 53x+11
Same base, set exponents equal
6x − 1 = 3x + 11
Move variables to one sides
− 3x
− 3x
Subtract 3x from both sides
3x − 1 = 11
Add 1 to both sides
+ 1 + 1
3x = 12
Divide both sides by 3
3
3
x = 4
Our Solution
It may take a bit of practice to get use to knowing which base to use, but as we
practice we will get much quicker at knowing which base to use. As we do so, we
will use our exponent properties to help us simplify. Again, below are the proper-
ties we used to simplify.
(ax)y = axy
and
1
an = a−n
and
axay = ax+y
We could see all three properties used in the same problem as we get a common
base. This is shown in the next example.
Example 534.
162x−5 ·
� 1
4
�3x+1
= 32 ·
� 1
2
�x+3
Write with a common base of 2
(24)2x−5 · (2−2)3x+1 = 25 · (2−1�x+3
Multiply exponents, distributing as needed
28x−20· 2−6x−2 = 25 · 2−x−3
Add exponents, combining like terms
22x−22= 2−x+2
Same base, set exponents equal
2x − 22 = − x + 2
Move variables to one side
+ x
+ x
Add x to both sides
3x − 22 = 2
Add 22 to both sides
+ 22 + 22
3x = 24
Divide both sides by 3
3
3
x = 8
Our Solution
All the problems we have solved here we were able to write with a common base.
However, not all problems can be written with a common base, for example, 2 =
10x, we cannot write this problem with a common base. To solve problems like
this we will need to use the inverse of an exponential function. The inverse is
called a logarithmic function, which we will discuss in another secion.

Functions - Logarithmic Functions
Objective: Convert between logarithms and exponents and use that
relationship to solve basic logarithmic equations.
The inverse of an exponential function is a new function known as a logarithm.
Lograithms are studied in detail in advanced algebra, here we will take an intro-
ductory look at how logarithms works. When working with radicals we found that
there were two ways to write radicals. The expression
an
m√
could be written as
a
n
m. Each form has its advantages, thus we need to be comfortable using both the
radical form and the rational exponent form. Similarly an exponent can be
written in two forms, each with its own advantages. The ﬁrst form we are very
familiar with, bx = a, where b is the base, a can be thought of as our answer, and
x is the exponent. The second way to write this is with a logarithm, logba = x.
The word “log” tells us that we are in this new form. The variables all still mean
the same thing. b is still the base, a can still be thought of as our answer.
Using this idea the problem 52 = 25 could also be written as log525 = 2. Both
mean the same thing, both are still the same exponent problem, but just as roots
can be written in radical form or rational exponent form, both our forms have
their own advantages. The most important thing to be comfortable doing with
logarithms and exponents is to be able to switch back and forth between the two
forms. This is what is shown in the next few examples.
Example 535.
Write each exponential equation in logarithmic form
m3 = 5

Our Solution
Once we are comfortable switching between logarithmic and exponential form we
are able to evaluate and solve logarithmic expressions and equations. We will ﬁrst
evaluate logarithmic expressions. An easy way to evaluate a logarithm is to set
the logarithm equal to x and change it into an exponential equation.
Example 537.

Set logarithm equal to x

1628 which listed logarithms calculated out from 1 to 100,000!

Solve equations with logarithms is done in a very similar way, we simply will
change the equation into exponential form and try to solve the resulting equation.

25 = x

Our Solution
Example 542.
logx8 = 3
Change to exponential form
x3 = 8
Cube root of both sides
x = 2
Our Solution
There is one base on a logarithm that gets used more often than any other base,
base 10. Similar to square roots not writting the common index of 2 in the rad-
ical, we don’t write the common base of 10 in the logarithm. So if we are working
on a problem with no base written we will always assume that base is base 10.
Example 543.
log x = − 2
Rewrite as exponent, 10 is base
10−2 = x
Evaluate, remember negative exponent is fraction

100 = x
Our Solution
This lesson has introduced the idea of logarithms, changing between logs and
exponents, evaluating logarithms, and solving basic logarithmic equations. In an
advanced algebra course logarithms will be studied in much greater detail.

Functions - Compound Interest
Objective: Calculate ﬁnal account balances using the formulas for com-
pound and continuous interest.
An application of exponential functions is compound interest. When money is
invested in an account (or given out on loan) a certain amount is added to the
balance. This money added to the balance is called interest. Once that interest is
added to the balance, it will earn more interest during the next compounding
period. This idea of earning interest on interest is called compound interest. For
example, if you invest S100 at 10% interest compounded annually, after one year
you will earn S10 in interest, giving you a new balance of S110. The next year
you will earn another 10% or S11, giving you a new balance of S121. The third
year you will earn another 10% or S12.10, giving you a new balance of S133.10.
This pattern will continue each year until you close the account.
There are several ways interest can be paid. The ﬁrst way, as described above, is
compounded annually. In this model the interest is paid once per year. But
interest can be compounded more often. Some common compounds include com-
pounded semi-annually (twice per year), quarterly (four times per year, such as
quarterly taxes), monthly (12 times per year, such as a savings account), weekly
(52 times per year), or even daily (365 times per year, such as some student
loans). When interest is compounded in any of these ways we can calculate the
balance after any amount of time using the following formula:
Compound Interest Formula: A = P
�
1 + r
n
�nt
A = Final Amount
P = Principle (starting balance)
r = Interest rate (as a decimal)
n = number of compounds per year
t = time (in years)
Example 544.
If you take a car loan for S25000 with an interest rate of 6.5% compounded quar-
terly, no payments required for the ﬁrst ﬁve years, what will your balance be at
the end of those ﬁve years?
P = 25000, r = 0.065, n = 4, t = 5
Identify each variable
A = 25000

Plug each value into formula, evaluate parenthesis
A = 25000(1.01625)4·5
Multiply exponents

Evaluate exponent
A = 25000(1.38041977 � )
Multiply
A = 34510.49

We can also ﬁnd a missing part of the equation by using our techniques for
solving equations.
Example 545.
What principle will amount to S3000 if invested at 6.5% compounded weekly for
4 years?
A = 3000, r = 0.065, n = 52, t = 4

3000 = P

Divide each side by 1.296719528 �

Our Solution
It is interesting to compare equal investments that are made at several diﬀerent
types of compounds. The next few examples do just that.
Example 546.
If S4000 is invested in an account paying 3% interest compounded monthly, what
is the balance after 7 years?
P = 4000, r = 0.03, n = 12, t = 7

Multiply
A = 4933.42
S4933.42
Our Solution
415
To investigate what happens to the balance if the compounds happen more often,
we will consider the same problem, this time with interest compounded daily.
Example 547.
If S4000 is invested in an account paying 3% interest compounded daily, what is
the balance after 7 years?
P = 4000, r = 0.03, n = 365, t = 7
Identify each variable
A = 4000
�

Plug each value into formula, evaluate parenthesis
A = 4000(1.00008219 � )365·7
Multiply exponent
A = 4000(1.00008219 � )2555
Evaluate exponent
A = 4000(1.23366741 � .)
Multiply
A = 4934.67
S4934.67
Our Solution
While this diﬀerence is not very large, it is a bit higher. The table below shows
the result for the same problem with diﬀerent compounds.

As the table illustrates, the more often interest is compounded, the higher the
ﬁnal balance will be. The reason is, because we are calculating compound interest
or interest on interest. So once interest is paid into the account it will start
earning interest for the next compound and thus giving a higher ﬁnal balance.
The next question one might consider is what is the maximum number of com-
pounds possible? We actually have a way to calculate interest compounded an
inﬁnite number of times a year. This is when the interest is compounded continu-
ously. When we see the word “continuously” we will know that we cannot use the
ﬁrst formula. Instead we will use the following formula:
Interest Compounded Continuously: A = Pert
A = Final Amount
P = Principle (starting balance)
e = a constant approximately 2.71828183 � .
r = Interest rate (written as a decimal)
t = time (years)
416
The variable e is a constant similar in idea to pi (π) in that it goes on forever
without repeat or pattern, but just as pi (π) naturally occurs in several geometry
applications, so does e appear in many exponential applications, continuous
interest being one of them. If you have a scientiﬁc calculator you probably have
an e button (often using the 2nd or shift key, then hit ln) that will be useful in
calculating interest compounded continuously.
World
View
Note: e ﬁrst appeared in 1618 in Scottish mathematician’s
Napier’s work on logarithms. However it was Euler in Switzerland who used the
letter e ﬁrst to represent this value. Some say he used e because his name begins
with E. Others, say it is because exponent starts with e. Others say it is because
Euler’s work already had the letter a in use, so e would be the next value. What-
ever the reason, ever since he used it in 1731, e became the natural base.
Example 548.
If S4000 is invested in an account paying 3% interest compounded continuously,
what is the balance after 7 years?
P = 4000, r = 0.03, t = 7

Albert Einstein once said that the most powerful force in the universe is com-
pound interest. Consider the following example, illustrating how powerful com-
pound interest can be.
Example 549.
If you invest S6.16 in an account paying 12% interest compounded continuously
for 100 years, and that is all you have to leave your children as an inheritance,
what will the ﬁnal balance be that they will receive?
P = 6.16, r = 0.12, t = 100
Identify each of the variables
A = 6.16e0.12·100
Multiply exponent
A = 6.16e12
Evaluate
A = 6.16(162, 544.79)
Multiply
A = 1, 002, 569.52
S1, 002, 569.52
Our Solution
In 100 years that one time investment of S6.16 investment grew to over one mil-
lion dollars! That’s the power of compound interest!

Objective: Solve for a missing side of a right triangle using trigono-

There are six special functions that describe the relationship between the sides of
a right triangle and the angles of the triangle. We will discuss three of the func-
tions here. The three functions are called the sine, cosine, and tangent (the three
others are cosecant, secant, and cotangent, but we will not need to use them
here).
To the right is a picture of a right tri-
angle. Based on which angle we are
interested in on a given problem we
will name the three sides in relation-
ship to that angle.
In the picture,
angle A is the angle we will use to
name the other sides. The longest side,
the side opposite the right angle is
always called the hypotenouse.
The
side across from the angle A is called
the opposite side.
A
Hypotenuse
Adjacent
Opposite
The third side, the side between our angle and the right angle is called the adja-
cent side. It is important to remember that the opposite and adjacent sides are
named in relationship to the angle A or the angle we are using in a problem. If
the angle had been the top angle, the opposite and adjacent sides would have
been switched.
The three trigonometric funtions are functions taken of angles. When an angle
goes into the function, the output is a ratio of two of the triangle sides. The
ratios are as describe below:
sinθ =
opposite
hypotenuse
cosθ =
adjacent
hypotenuse
tanθ = opposite
adjacent
The “weird” variable θ is a greek letter, pronounced “theta” and is close in idea to
our letter “t”. Often working with triangles, the angles are repesented with Greek
letters, in honor of the Ancient Greeks who developed much of Geometry. Some
students remember the three ratios by remembering the word “SOH CAH TOA”
where each letter is the ﬁrst word of: “Sine: Opposite over Hypotenuse; Cosine:
Adjacent over Hypotenuse; and Tangent: Opposite over Adjacent.” Knowing how
to use each of these relationships is fundamental to solving problems using
trigonometry.
World View Note: The word “sine” comes from a mistranslation of the Arab
word jayb
Example 550.
420
Using the diagram at right, ﬁnd each
of the following: sinθ, cosθ, tanθ, sinα,
cosα, and tanα.
First we will ﬁnd the three ratios of θ.
The hypotenuse is 10, from θ, the
opposite side is 6 and the adjacent
side is 8. So we ﬁll in the following:
sinθ =
opposite
hypotenuse = 6
10 = 3
5
cosθ =
adjacent
hypotenuse = 8
10 = 4
5
tanθ = opposite
adjacent = 6
8 = 3
4
Now we will ﬁnd the three ratios of α.
The hypotenuse is 10, from α, the
opposite side is 8 and the adjacent
side is 6. So we ﬁll in the following:
6
8
10
α
θ
10
8
α
θ
Opposite of θ
Adjacent of α
6
Hypotenuse
Adjacent of θ
Opposite of α
sinα =
opposite
hypotenuse = 8
10 = 4
5
cosα =
adjacent
hypotenuse = 6
10 = 3
5
tanα = opposite
adjacent = 8
6 = 4
3
We can either use a trigonometry table or a calculator to ﬁnd decimal values for
sine, cosine, or tangent of any angle. We only put angle values into the trigono-
metric functions, never values for sides. Using either a table or a calculator, we
can solve the next example.
Example 551.
sin 42◦
Use calculator or table
0.669
Our Solution
tan 12◦
Use calculator or table
0.213
Our Solution
cos 18◦
Use calculator or table
0.951
Our Solution
By combining the ratios together with the decimal approximations the calculator
or table gives us, we can solve for missing sides of a triangle. The trick will be to
determine which angle we are working with, naming the sides we are working
with, and deciding which trig function can be used with the sides we have.
421
Example 552.
Find the measure of the missing side.
x
4
25◦
We will be using the angle marked
25◦, from this angle, the side marked 4
is
the
opposite
side
and
the
side
marked x is the adjacent side.
The trig ratio that uses the opposite
and adjacent sides is tangent. So we
will take the tangent of our angle.
tan25◦ = 4
x
Tangent is opposite over adjacent
0.466
1
= 4
x
Evaluate tan25◦, put over 1 so we have proportion
0.466x = 4
Find cross product
0.466 0.466
Divide both sides by 0.466
x = 8.58
Our Solution
Example 553.
Find the measure of the missing side.
x
9
70◦
We will be using the angle marked
70◦. From this angle, the x is the
adjacent
side
and
the
9
is
the
hypotenuse.
The trig ratio that uses adjacent and
hypotenuse is the cosine. So we will
take the cosine of our angle.
cos70◦ = x
9
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse
0.342
1
= x
9
Evaluate cos70◦, put over 1 so we have a proportion
3.08 = 1x
Find the cross product.
3.08 = x

Functions - Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Objective: Solve for missing angles of a right triangle using inverse
trigonometry.
We used a special function, one of the trig functions, to take an angle of a triangle
and ﬁnd the side length. Here we will do the opposite, take the side lengths and
ﬁnd the angle. Because this is the opposite operation, we will use the inverse
function of each of the trig ratios we saw before. The notation we will use for the
inverse trig functions will be similar to the inverse notation we used with func-
tions.
sin−1
�
opposite
hypotenuse
�
= θ
cos−1
�
adjacent
hypotenuse
�
= θ tan−1
� opposite
adjacent
�
= θ
Just as with inverse functions, the − 1 is not an exponent, it is a notation to tell
us that these are inverse functions. While the regular trig functions take angles as
inputs, these inverse functions will always take a ratio of sides as inputs. We can
calculate inverse trig values using a table or a calculator (usually pressing shift or
2nd ﬁrst).
Example 554.
sinA = 0.5
We don′t know the angle so we use an inverse trig function
sin−1(0.5) = A
Evaluate using table or calculator
30◦ = A
Our Solution
cosB = 0.667
We don′t know the angle so we use an inverse trig function
cos−1(0.667) = B
Evaluate using table or calculator
48◦ = B
Our Solution
tanC = 1.54
We don′t know the angle so we use an inverse trig function
tan−1(1.54) = C
Evaluate using table or calculator
57◦ = C
Our Solution
If we have two sides of a triangle, we can easily calculate their ratio as a decimal
and then use one of the inverse trig functions to ﬁnd a missing angle.
Example 555.
Find the indicated angle.
428
12
17
θ
From angle θ the given sides are the
opposite (12) and the hypotenuse (17).
The trig function that uses opposite
and hypotenuse is the sine
Because we are looking for an angle
we use the inverse sine
sin−1
� 12
17
�
Sine is opposite over hyptenuse, use inverse to ﬁnd angle
sin−1(0.706)
Evaluate fraction, take sine inverse using table or calculator
45◦
Our Solution
Example 556.
Find the indicated angle
3
5
α
From the angle α, the given sides are
the opposite (5) and the adjacent (3)
The trig function that uses opposite
and adjacent is the tangent
As we are looking for an angle we will
use the inverse tangent.
tan−1
� 5
3
�
Tangent is opposite over adjacent. Use inverse to ﬁnd angle
tan−1(1.667)
Evaluate fraction, take tangent inverse on table or calculator
59◦
Our Solution
Using a combination of trig functions and inverse trig functions, if we are given
two parts of a right triangle (two sides or a side and an angle), we can ﬁnd all the
other sides and angles of the triangle. This is called solving a triangle.
When we are solving a triangle, we can use trig ratios to solve for all the missing
parts of it, but there are some properties from geometry that may be helpful
along the way.
The angles of a triangle always add up to 180◦, because we have a right triangle,
90◦ are used up in the right angle, that means there are another 90◦ left in the
two acute angles. In other words, the smaller two angles will always add to 90, if
we know one angle, we can quickly ﬁnd the other by subtracting from 90.
Another trick is on the sides of the angles. If we know two sides of the right tri-
angle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to ﬁnd the third side.
The
Pythagorean Theorem states that if c is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and a and
429
b are the other two sides (legs), then we can use the following formula, a2 + b2 = c2
to ﬁnd a missing side.
Often when solving triangles we use trigonometry to ﬁnd one part, then use the
angle sum and/or the Pythagorean Theorem to ﬁnd the other two parts.
Example 557.
Solve the triangle
5
35◦
We have one angle and one side. We
can use these to ﬁnd either other side.
We will ﬁnd the other leg, the adja-
cent side to the 35◦ angle.
The 5 is the opposite side, so we will
use the tangent to ﬁnd the leg.
tan35◦ = 5
x
Tangent is opposite over adjacent
0.700
1
= 5
x
Evaluate tangent, put it over one so we have a proportion
0.700x = 5
Find cross product
0.700 0.700
Divide both sides by 0.700
x = 7.1
The missing leg.
a2 + b2 = c2
We can now use pythagorean thorem to ﬁnd hypotenuse, c
52 + 7.12 = c2
Evaluate exponents
25 + 50.41 = c2
Add
75.41 = c2
Square root both sides
8.7 = c
The hypotenuse
90◦ − 35◦
To ﬁnd the missing angle we subtract from 90◦
55◦
The missing angle
35◦
55◦
5
7.1
8.7
Our Solution
In the previous example, once we found the leg to be 7.1 we could have used the
sine function on the 35◦ angle to get the hypotenuse and then any inverse trig
430
function to ﬁnd the missing angle and we would have found the same answers.
The angle sum and pythagorean theorem are just nice shortcuts to solve the
problem quicker.
Example 558.
Solve the triangle
3
9
In this triangle we have two sides. We
will ﬁrst ﬁnd the angle on the right
side, adjacent to 3 and opposite from
the 9.
Tangent uses opposite and adjacent
To ﬁnd an angle we use the inverse
tangent.

The angle on the right side
90◦ − 71.6◦
Subtract angle from 90◦ to get other angle
18.4◦
The angle on the left side
a2 + b2 = c2
Pythagorean theorem to ﬁnd hypotenuse
92 + 32 = c2
Evaluate exponents
81 + 9 = c2
Add
